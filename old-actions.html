				<h2>Hermeneutics</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap i">I</span>n the time of the Titans, Mētis was daughter of Tethys the Oceanid and sister of Prometheus. Her divine portfolio included wisdom, counsel, shapeshifting, and trickery. It was Mētis, of course, who devised the stratagem that freed the Olympians from Kronos' belly and thus enabled Zeus to become king of the gods. After the overthrow of the Titans, Metis became Zeus' first wife and his queen.</p>
				<p>But Zeus, fearing the power of the children she would bear, caught Mētis by a trick (with the help of his mother and grandmother) and swallowed her whole, taking her power for himself and, in the words of linguists Marcel Detienne and Paul Vernant (1972), becoming "himself pure <em>mētis</em>". As such, Zeus realized his full and eternal authority over gods and men, for as long he contained within himself this font of cunning, no god or group of gods could take him by surprise or overthrow him. Detienne and Vernant explain: "Not a single cunning trick can be plotted in the universe without first passing through his mind" (p.14), meaning Zeus is forewarned of any possible plot against him.</p>
				<p>However, before Zeus swallowed her, Metis had become pregnant. The unborn child did not perish as a result of the violence and eventually she sprang from Zeus' forehead "fully formed and equipped with the arms of war" (Hesiod). Athena, chief goddess during the golden age of Greece, became one of the most important mythical figures of history, a patron of the arts and champion of democracy. Her symbol was the owl, and wisdom her most distinctive characteristic. Whether advising Odysseus in the stratagems of war or teaching her artisans the <em>tēchne pantoie</em>, the "art of many facets" (D&V), Athena brought forth the gifts of <em>mētis</em> Zeus tried to keep for himself.</p>
				<p>This story aptly illustrates some key characteristics of the role <em>mētis</em> has played in the rhetorical tradition. Like its namesake, rhetorical mētis was a primeaval part of the tradition. When Plato excoriates the practice of sophistry in the Gorgias dialogue, it's deceptive nature is a key part of his critique. Aristotle recovers some parts of mētis in his Rhetoric, as Atwill relates in the concept of <em>tēchne</em> (???) and the idea that rhetoric cannot be learned as a formula. Debra Hawee, in her writings on rhetorical embodiment, explains how movements of the body, informed by metis, help constitute rhetoric (48). In an article on rhetorical bodies across traditions, Jay Dolmage argues that the rhetorical tradition we've canonized effaces and silences other rhetorical traditions, one of which, he writes, involves metis.</p>

				<h2>Agency</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he history of mētis is a long one. Detienne and Vernant, the French linguists who published the most authoritative work on the subject, trace its appearance through ten centuries of Greek history, from Homer down to Oppian, in the second century AD, but it hardly stops there. In our disciplinary literature at least it appears in the 80's and 90's with Atwill and Hawhee, and again in the 10's with Jay Dolmage and with Karen Kopelson. These writers put metis to different uses, but all acknowledge it's place as a rhetorical concept.</p>
				<p>According to Dettiene and Vernant, there are four essential characteristics of metis that are interrelated. In the summary that follows, it will become apparent that the first three of these essential characteristics have survived relatively intact in the rhetorical tradition, making the fourth all the more conspicuous by its absence.</p>
				<h4>1. Deeply Subversive</h4>
				<p>In contests when one side greatly outmatches the other, the weaker must employ "methods of a different order whose effect is, precisely, to reverse the natural outcome of the encounter" (13).</p>
				<p>In rhetoric this characteristic survives as the concept of "dissoi logoi", or counterveilling arguments, that seek to make "the weaker argument the stronger", and it also forms the basis of Plato's critique of sophistry in the Gorgias dialogue. When outmatched by a greater force, metis turns to other methods than strength to achieve success.</p>
				<h4>2. Utterly Temporal</h4>
				<p>The second characteristic of Metis is its temporal nature. Detienne and Vernant write that it "operates on a shifting terrain, in uncertain and ambiguous situations" (14). It involves foresight, (Prometheus after all, gets his very name from metis), beccause, in order to act with cunning, one must not only fully appreciate the past and live profoundly in the moment, but also be able to see the likely outcome of events in the future.</p>
				<p>In rhetoric, this characteristic survives in the concept of kairos, or opportune timing. If kairos is opportunity, then metis is the eye that watches for it. Dettient and Vernant write: "It is metis which, overtaking the kairos, however fleeting it may be, catches it by surprise" (16).</p>
				<h4>3. Fluently Polymorphous</h4>
				<p>The third characteristic of Metis is polymorphism. Metis is not one and unified, Dettiene and Vernant tell us, but many and variable. Odysseus embodies this as an "expert in tricks of all kinds" (18). Athena and Haephestus teach it to their artisans, who acquire "techne pantoie" or the "art of many facets" (18).</p>
				<p>In rhetoric, this characteristic survives in the concept of copia, or, as Erasmus put it more fully: the "twofold abundance of expressions and ideas". Rhetors make use of copia in much the same way artisans do the "art of many facets," to find expedients, poroi, that are hidden. Porous, or expedient, is a related concept that also expresses the idea of fullness or abundance. In fact, the god Poros was figured by Plato in the Symposium as the son of Metis, so the relationship is not only clear, it's enshrined in myth.</p>
				<h4>4. Fundamentally Deceptive</h4>
				<p>The final characteristic of metis is its deceitful nature. Metis has a false face. It relies on disguise, camouflage, and dissimulation. The perfect metaphor is the net, the trap, the snare. Metis makes use of illusion, like "the spells of a magician" (22), to befuddle and persuade. It is a trap which "conceals its inner deceit beneath a seductive exterior" (23).</p>
				<p>This is the only characteristic of metis without a cognate in the mainstream rhetorical tradition. To the contrary, rhetoric explicitly rejects deceit and duplicity throughout a great swath of rhetorical history, from Plato's Gorgias, to Quintillian's "vir bonum" up until the Neo-Aristotelian concept of Ethos taught in classrooms today, which holds dishonesty as anathema to good rhetoric.</p>
