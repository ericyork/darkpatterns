			    <h1>Disguise</h1>
					<p>Dark patterns in this category use the visual properties of objects, such as size, shape, color, and depth to make a malicious object appear to be another, more benign object instead.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<div class="entry-wrap">
						<div class="eg-text">
							<p>This kind of dark pattern operates almost entirely through manipulation of visual properties and has less to do with actual content, except inasmuch as the true content of things has been disguised by the design. We’ve already seen one example of disguise in Figure ##, “Fake Hair”, but here we’ll focus on the “Strikingly Ad” posted by @twitterhandle on Month Day, year.</p>
							<p>In Figure ## we see the advertisement as it would appear on a mobile device: annoyingly jutting up from the bottom of the screen and covering precious pixels of screen real estate. Helpfully, a downward-pointing triangle seems to offer the option of closing the panel, however, when clicked, the triangle instead takes users to a webpage. The downward-pointing triangle is the thing that’s been disguised: an external link has been rendered as a panel toggle. The thing, a link, doesn’t match its representation, a toggle.</p>
							<p>In terms of metis, this example exhibits all four aspects. The purpose of the design is to reverse the user’s intention: instead of closing the advertisement, the user must be made to visit the site. Deactivate must be converted to activate. The Strikingly ad must first create an opportunity, it must prompt an action. It does this by creating what appears to be a collapsible panel that obscures part of the screen.</p>
							<p>To reclaim this portion of their screen, the user looks for a way to dismiss the panel and spots a prominently rendered downward-pointing triangle, commonly called a caret, that typically signifies, or stands in for, a means of collapsing such panels. In fact, the hidden functionality of this interface element is to trigger, not the collapse of the panel, but instead a navigational link that loads a document on another server: in this case apparently Strikingly’s website. This probably serves to creates artificial traffic to the host site and inflate its value.</p>
							<p>The “form” or “design” of the navigational link has been transformed into a caret, and this disguise allows something malicious, intentionally misdirected traffic, to masquerade as something benign. Like the bait of the angler fish, “inner malice is concealed beneath a seductive exterior” (p.??). This disguise is effected by exploiting the conventions of visual design: by convention, collapsible panels have a way to close them, and by convention this is often represented by a downward-pointing caret.</p>
							<p>This is reinforced by the fact that direction the caret points is the direction in which the user wants to “send” the panel. Aside from these semiotic confusions, the disguise also works by by exploiting what's known as “Jakob’s Law of User Experience”,  after UX pioneer Jakob Nielsen, which states: “Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know” (Yablonski, 2019).</p>
							<p>In visual rhetorical terms, this is related to two gestalt principles: the Law of Similarity and the Law of Common Fate. The Law of Similarity is simply that objects that are visually similar are perceived to be part of group. The Law of Common Fate states that objects moving in the same direction are perceived as belonging to a group. Based on these simple rules, users will expect the downward-pointing caret to collapse the panel that contains it, not take them to another site entirely.</p>

			    <h1>Camouflage</h1>

							<h3>Very Low Contrast</h3>
							<p>This example is quite typical. The link to unsubscribe from the list appears near the very bottom of the document, at a very small size&mdash;in the digital fine print, as it were. This particular example, though, amplifies the fine print effect by setting the color of the text and the color of the background to be only slightly different, making it much harder to read.</p>
							<p>The color of the word “unsubscribe” is set equal to the color of the surrounding text, rather than to the color of other links, as can be seen by comparing “unsubscribe” with “peter@gmail.com”. The WCAG 2.0 specify a <em>minimum</em> (Level A) contrast of 3:1 for text approximately 18 pixels in height. Smaller text requires higher contrast, and this minimal level is largely ignored in favor of the industry standard (Level AA) contrast of 4.5:1. In this example, the color contrast is so poor it fails minimal conformance testing at any size.</p>

							<h3>Lack of Affordance</h3>
							<p>In this variation, the link to unsubscribe is too small and has poor contrast as before, but in addition it also lacks the underline affordance that is a feature of other links. In UI-speak, an affordance is a visual feature that gives the user some clue as to the function of a particular element: in this case that the word is a clickable hyperlink.</p>
							<p>Since other clickable hyperlinks on the page are underlined, and due to the <em>gestalt</em> principle of similarity that declares that elements that are visually similar are percieved as part of a group, a user may well conclude the word “unsubscribe” is not a link.</p>
							<p>This example and the others in this category all rely on a common <em>gestalt</em> principle, figure-ground. Making it difficult for viewers to distinguish which is figure and which is ground is the basis of many well-known visual illusions, and it takes advantage of internet readers' wewll-known tendency to skim. Now that we've focused on the unsubscribe links, they may be more visible. Imagine encountering them in their natural contexts, as part of much larger pages of information.</p>

							<h3>Burying the Lede</h3>
							<p>This example takes the pattern a step further. In addition to removing affordances like color and underlining, the unsubscribe link is placed about as near in the center of the page as possible, buried at the end of a sentence in the middle of an otherwise nondescript paragraph.</p>
							<p>A user skimming the page to locate the unsubscribe link would have a difficult time indeed in spotting it, and all the more so if the user suspects the link might be on a different page entirely, as the text at the very bottom of the image is careful to point out.</p>
							<p>This example illustates how powerful the <em>gestalt</em> principles of similarity and proximity can be when used in consort with figure-ground: finding a single barely-distinguishable word among scores of other words is like finding a needle in a haystack. Posssible, certainly, but surely tedious in the extreme.</p>
							<p>It's interesting to note here how color is used not so the link blends into the background (the text contrast meets AA conformance), but rather so that it will better blend in with the text around it. This is a slight adaptation of the figure-ground exploit.</p>

							<h3>Link Shifting</h3>
							<p>This example combines several of the previous exploits and adds a new one. In addition to poor contrast (fails Level A conformance) and tiny font size (it's 11 pixels, much smaller than the 18px commonly used for regular text, and lacks link affordance (no underline), this example also shifts the location of the hyperlink.</p>
							<p>In previous variations of this pattern, the word “unsubscribe” <em>is</em> a link, even if they don't look like it, but in this version, the actual hyperlink is around the word “link” instead.</p>
							<p>This example seems targetted toward a savvier user&mdash;one wise to the ways of disguised unsubscribe links and innured to their techniques. In the case, however, the savvy user may well try to click on the word “unsubscsribe” a few times before giving up, believing there to be no link here at all.</p>
							<p>Meanwhile, the real link hides a few words away, the effectiveness of its disguise renewed by means of what amounts to a distraction, a red herring, if you will. In first proferring a flawed disguise, the real link is able to perpertrate the same disguise more effectively.</p>

							<h3>Perfect Camouflage</h3>
							<p><em>Please note</em>: this example is an animated .gif. To view the example, just click the blue play button on the video in the example, or visit Twitter.com by clicking anywhere on the tweet.</p>
							<p>The lowest possible contrast ratio, the theoretical limit, if you will, is 1:1, meaning the text color and the background color are identical and the text would by definition be unreadable. That's precisely the technique used in this example.</p>
							<p>On the web, hyperlinks have four “states”: initial, active, visited, and hovered. Web developers need to specify the colors and styles for each state. In this case, the developer has styled the link to be visible only when the user hovers the mouse over the text.</p>
							<p>While the uninitiated may think this could just be an accident, as a developer myself I can tell you that it's not. I can't think of way this could happen by accident. The developer in this example must've intentionally used lack of contrast to hide the link.</p>
