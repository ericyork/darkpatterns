### Abstract
This webtext analyzes a class of deceptive interfaces known as dark patterns. Dark patterns constitute the extreme case when human interpretation fails spectacularly and they have much to teach us about the visual-rhetorical mechanism by which their deception is effected. After better defining these types of interfaces and situating them in the context of their closest relatives (i.e. online deception and misleading graphs), this webtext develops a dual theory of dark patterns based in the ancient concept of mÃªtis, or rhetorical cunning, and the Gestalt principles of visual design related to optical illusion and perspective. This theory is used to interpret dark patterns of six representative types (displayed in a gallery along with their variants) to show how it can support a reading of other deceptive texts and web interfaces more broadly.
