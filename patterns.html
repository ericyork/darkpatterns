			<h2>Design Patterns</h2>
			<p><span class="dropcap i">I</span>n design discourse, patterns are established solutions to recurring problems that, if sufficiently abstracted, can be adapted to different contexts. In their seminal urban planning text, <em>A Pattern Language</em>, Alexander et al. (1977) write that a design pattern “describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing the same thing twice” (p. 10). For example in interface design, a dropdown list is a pattern that solves the problem of presenting too much information at once. When abstracted, it can be reused in variety of situations, from presenting menu items to unveiling entire control panels. But, being context-free can itself be a problem, as is the case with a particular subset of design pattern: the antipattern.</p>
			<p>According to Brown et. al (1998), in their book <em>AntiPattern</em>, “a design pattern becomes an AntiPattern when it causes more problems than it solves” (p.2). They go on to write the antipattern “may be the result of a manager or developer not knowing any better, not having sufficient knowledge or experience in solving a particular type of problem, or having applied a perfectly good pattern in the wrong context” (p. 6). For example, if the dropdown list only held one item (instead of several) it’s an antipattern: it requires more effort from users than it saves them. But, and in radical contrast, if the dropdown menu also triggered a malicious script that compromised a user’s machine, that would be something else entirely: it would be a dark pattern.</p>
			<p>Brignull (2013), who coined the term “dark pattern” in 2010, defines it as an “interface carefully crafted to trick users into doing things they might not otherwise do” (p.1). Typically, this might range from making it difficult to unsubscribe from a mailing list to sneaking items into a shopping basket, or more problematically, from coercing users into giving away their personal information to outright stealing their identities. If design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems and antipatterns are poorly or improperly implemented solutions, then dark patterns are solutions that harm users in order to benefit designers. While the antipattern comes about through incompetence, the dark pattern is actively malignant.</p>
			<p>When Brignull founded darkpatterns.org in 2010 and started the #darkpatterns hashtag on Twitter, numerous types had already been identified in the catalogue and examples posted to the “Wall of Shame”. Since then, as awareness of the concept spread and support for the project grew, thousands more examples have been added and the hashtag is currently still quite active, with a number of recent contributions at the time of this writing. During these years, various discussions also appeared in design-focused outlets such as <em>Ars Technica</em>, <em>UX Planet</em>, and others, but events of the most recent U.S. presidential election propelled dark patterns from relative obscurity into mainstream political discussion. In “The Year Dark Patterns Won”, Campbell-Dollaghan (2016) argues that in the run up to the election, dark patterns were “wielded as weapons against democracy” (p.1) in the form of fake news and massively large-scale invasions of privacy.</p>

				<h2>Trolling</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap d">D</span>ark patterns didn’t appear out of nowhere in 2010 and then become a juggernaut by 2016. Instead, such online deception pre-dates the invention of the Internet itself. In the decade before the rise of the World Wide Web, MUDs (multi-user domains) and Usenet groups comprised the first online social spaces where people from disparate geophysical locations came together to create “virtual communities” (Donnath, 1997 p.11). In such spaces, people adopted various social roles, such as the ‘celebrity’, the ‘newbie’, and the ‘lurker’ (Golder and Donath 2004) much as they do in real life, albeit with important differences.</p>
				<p>For example, social roles such as “Troll” are far more prevalent online because anonymity is so readily available. Golder and Donath describe the Troll as a “master of identity deception”, whose modus operandi relies on being “adept at understanding and using the styles of speech a community deems acceptable, so as to not appear as an outsider,” in order that “his identity as a Troll and therefore his true motive is not known until it is too late” (p.18). The Troll’s function in the social group is enabled by an ability to blend in, to create a disguise effective enough to deceive members of the group, highly-tuned as they are to its discursive conventions. Importantly, Golder and Donath note “the more competence one has in the register of the community, the easier one will be able to identify a Troll’s deviant behavior” (p.18), pointing to the fact that knowledge of discursive convention is a crucial defense against online deception.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="catfishing">
				<h2>Catfishing</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he same kind of disguise used by the Troll can enable other kinds of deviant social behavior. For example, in what might be the first truly infamous case of online deception, and the first well-documented case of what is now known as ‘catfishing’, Van Gelder (1985) relates the story of Joan Sue Green, a neuropsychologist in her late twenties who had been disfigured, rendered mute, and badly disabled in a car accident that had killed her boyfriend. Over a period of two years beginning in 1981, Joan, in the MUDs she frequented, “became a monumental on-line presence who served both as a support for other disabled women and as an inspiring stereotype-smasher to the able-bodied” (p.365). But Joan, it turns out, did not actually exist; she’d been fabricated whole cloth by a man, a prominent New York psychologist, as part of a “bizarre, all-consuming experiment to… experience the intimacy of female friendships” (p.365).</p>
				<p>But that’s to view it generously because he also persuaded women in the MUDs to have “compusex” (p.372) with him (as Joan), and even to meet *him* in real life (as Joan’s mentor and confidant) and tricked them into intimate relationships. The story of this sexual predator and the tragic figure he created is another example of how online deception is perpetrated: by someone pretending to be someone else. It also again illustrates how such deception is ultimately defeated: noticing “inconsistencies in her persona”, one of ‘Joan’s’ online friends confronted him, extracted a confession, and outed him to the community, using her understanding of discursive convention to unmask the predator, to expose his true identity, and thus render him impotent.</p>

				<h2>Trojans</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap d">D</span>eception has been part of the Internet essentially from the beginning. A prime example from the early period, and one still in existence, is called ‘phishing’, which combines social engineering and straight-up hacking to compromise users’ accounts. In a phishing attack, an unsuspecting user is contacted by someone posing as a representative of an organization and tricked into supplying account information—typically a username and password. In the mid-90’s, the widely distributed AOHell script package automated the phishing process and such attacks became widespread across the eponymous platform, leading to the now well-known communiqué that “no representative of this company will ask you for your password or other account details” — a relic of those attacks still enshrined in corporate practice today.</p>
				<p>Other examples of deception from this early period include URL spoofing (to hide a malicious web address), identity theft (to gain control of a user’s real-world financial data), and of course a vast taxonomy of computer viruses, worms, and trojans that purport to be legitimate programs, make themselves invisible, and secretly infiltrate and compromise system after system, spreading across networks like, to quote Michael Crighton’s 1973 film Westworld, an “infectious disease process” (???).</p>
				<p>And these early examples haven’t gone away. To the contrary, they still remain a ubiquitous and widespread threat to the extent that entire industries such as cyber-security and digital forensics have grown up over the intervening decades and the war between white-hat security experts and black-hat hackers has taken on the form of a lightning-fast arms race in which each side is engaged in rapid process of finding and patching/exploiting vulnerabilities as they become known. Indeed, system administrators today largely earn their living by applying patches and upgrades for so-called zero-day vulnerabilities as they are exposed.</p>
				<p>In fact, not only have incidents of deception online continued, today a myriad of new forms exist, such as ransomware, which encrypts an infected hard drive, rendering the data on it meaningless without the key, which hackers hold for ransom typically requested in the form of bitcoin or other anonymous currency.</p>
				<p>Another new form is called “privacy zuckering” named after Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and which denotes the practice of tricking users into giving away their personal information. Furthermore, new versions of old techniques have been emerged as well, such as spear-phishing (highly targeted phishing), and whaling (phishing targeted at very high levels of the organization). With the rise of wearable computers and the internet of things which promises highly ubiquitous connectivity, we are seeing the corresponding occurrence of new and emergent forms of malware targeting smart speakers, smart televisions, smart doorbells, smart door locks, smart thermostats, smart children’s toys, and the list goes on and on.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="fake-news">
				<h2>Fake News</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>wo final, more contemporary, examples serve to illustrate the continued prevalence of online deception: the disclosure of the personal information of tens of millions of unwitting U.S. citizens to Russian intelligence agents by social media giant Facebook during the 2016 presidential election and the corresponding information-warfare campaign conducted across social media platforms, in which bots and Russian intelligence agents posed as legitimate citizens to rapidly accelerate the dissemination of fake news and divisive polemic (Cite ???).</p>
				<p>The “Russian Troll Farm” (cite ???), as it came to be known, used the information received from Facebook (through an intermediary company, Cambridge Analytica), to inform and conduct a coordinated campaign of misinformation. In the months since these revelations were made public by intelligence agencies (including the F.B.I, the C.I.A and the N.S.A.), major social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have conducted extensive auditing and purged millions of illegitimate user accounts linked to the conspiracy (Cite ???). One of the ways the deceivers have been unmasked is, of course, by noticing discursive anomalies (such as supposedly native midwesterners writing with Russian “accents”) (cite ???).</p>
				<p>All of these deceptions are enabled in part by a largely ubiquitous anonymity, the primary affordance of the internet we’ve built. As the venerable New Yorker cartoon had it as far back as 1989, “on the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog” (???). Today, it is but a moment’s work to gain anonymity such that will defeat all but the most sophisticated inspection, beyond the reach of most people.</p>
				<p>With this anonymity comes power. In his chapter on the panopticon in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, Foucault writes that the ability to “dissimulate… to see without being seen” (???) is the foremost “technology of power” (???) shaping human history. The ability to see without being seen conveys power through “the differential possession of knowledge” (Barton and Barton ???), visual rhetoricians tell us. To craft such a disguise is precisely to dissimulate, to pretend to be other than you are. This ability is also one of the main characteristics of the kind of intelligence ancients called <em>mêtis</em>.</p>
