			<h2>Camouflage</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap w">W</span>hat makes dark patterns dark then, which is the same as what makes rhetoric “rhetrickery”, is a reliance on disguise. Instead of illuminating, it darkens; instead of revealing, it conceals. Dark patterns, like sophistic rhetoric, can be identified by the construction of their masks. When one reality is made to stand in for another, we know that we aren’t party to a good faith effort to persuade, but instead we’re being duped by a wily mind hoping to lull us into a false sense of security——for the better to rob us blind. To spot such deception means being able to distinguish among “the similarity and dissimilarity of things” (Bizzell and Hertzberg 198?, p.158).</p>
				<p>Detienne and Vernant tell us Plato and Aristotle both call this ability the “good eye (<em>eustochia</em>)”, and write: “In all the various domains in which <em>mêtis</em> operates a good eye is as important as an agile mind” (p.303). So it follows, to prepare our defense against dark patterns and online deception, we must attend to vision itself and the cognitive process by which vision is translated to thought.</p>
				<p>The image of the eye is endemic to Detienne and Vernant’s work and it appears in contexts ranging from hunting and fishing to chariot-racing, from navigation and medicine to sophistry. The hunter must be vigilant, the authors write, because “every animal with <em>mêtis</em> is a living eye which never closes or even blinks” (p.29). Likewise Antilochus, when performing the deceptive maneuver with his chariot must keep his eye “fixed on the post” (p.14) and “fixed on the competitor who is ahead” (p.15). In the context of navigation, “Odysseus steers his ship with… <em>mêtis</em>… his eyes fixed upon the Pleiades and Bootes” (p.236). The same is true in medicine and “the experienced eye of the doctor”  (p.2) which “must watch for the precise moment when his intervention will prove decisive” (p.312).</p>
				<p>In terms of rhetoric, the “man of prudence, the <em>phronimos</em> man, is . . . the man whose success owes more to a good eye than to an unshakable knowledge” (p.316). The fixed gaze by itself, it’s important to note, is not enough unless joined to the agile, experienced mind. This union is expressed in the concept of <em>eustochia</em> whereby the good eye is able to see similarities and differences between things, it “is an intellectual operation which lies half-way between reasoning by analogy and a skill at deciphering the signs which link what is visible to what is invisible” (p.314). In argumentation, this is the process known as conjecture and it has its etymological roots in celestial navigation and the plotting of the journey by the stars. The ability to reason by conjecture also plots its course by mapping like and unlike things.</p>
				<p>The reason the image of the eye is so prevalent in discussions of cunning is again due to the shifting, unstable nature of <em>mêtis</em> itself. Not only must <em>mêtis</em> remain ever vigilant and ready to pounce, it also must be capable of obscuring its movement so as to approach unseen; and so <em>mêtis</em> also has the quality of being multicolored or shimmering. Detienne and Vernant write that the word <em>mêtis</em> is often related in the literature to another word, <em>poikilos</em>, which refers to “the sheen of a material or the glittering of a weapon, the dappled hide of a fawn, or the shining back of a snake mottled with darker patches” (p.18). The dappling of the fawn, the mottling of the snake, “shields which glitter as they move” (p.19), all describe what is essentially camouflage, a surface appearing that conceals a different truth beneath.</p>
				<p>Camouflage hides the fawn from the hunter, conceals the approach of the snake through the grass, and disguises the number of men in the army. This disguise is effected primarily through visual means. Detienne and Vernant go on to explain “this many-coloured sheen or complex of appearances produces an effect of iridescence, shimmering, an interplay of reflections which the Greeks perceived as the ceaseless vibrations of light” (p.18). Faced with the complex of appearances, the eye becomes fascinated, beguiled by seemingly ceaseless motion and bound in place——<em>aporia</em>, without escape.</p>
				<p>For this same reason, when not multicolored, <em>mêtis</em> is associated with blackness and night. In the dark, the enemy can approach unseen and strike by surprise. For Detienne and Vernant, the exemplars are octopuses, that “are pure <em>aporai</em> and the impenetrable, pathless night that they secrete [their ink] is the most perfect image of their <em>mêtis</em>" (p.38). Whether through the interplay of light or through strategic darkness, <em>mêtis</em> uses visual means to distract and fascinate. In effect, <em>mêtis</em> dissimulates, pretends to be other than it is, so it can “see without being seen” (p.30).</p>
				<p>In visual displays, we may see a benign version of this in the concept of chartjunk, a term coined by Tufte (1983) which applies to a class of misleading graphics characterized by excessive decoration. For Tufte, chartjunk consists of three sub-categories: unintentional optic art, the grid, and the duck, and the main impression it makes on readers is one of carelessness, sloppiness, or laziness, as Tufte writes it “comes cheaper than the hard work required to produce intriguing numbers and secure evidence” (p. 107). Tufte tends to write about chartjunk as a somewhat humorous byproduct of new technologies and the designer’s (understandable) impulse to “enliven the display” (p.107).</p>
				<p>But Tufte also acknowledges chartjunk’s deceptive potential when he writes it can be employed to “make the graphic appear more scientific and precise” (p.107), and that “the noise clouds the information flow” (p.108). He notes that use of a grid “camouflages the profile of the data” (p.113), and uses words like “phoney”, “fake” (118) and “false” (121) to characterize it. Even the name itself, chartjunk, is highly pejorative. For Tufte the question of intentionality, that is, whether the graphic is intended to mislead, is immaterial because chartjunk is “bad art and bad data graphics” (p.108) and so has no place in scientific, technical, or professional communication, whatever its intent.</p>
				<p>The ability to dissimulate, to see-without-being seen, is crucial to the postmodern study of culture and to visual rhetoric especially. According to Foucault’s history of the technologies of power in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, the blueprint for modern society is the military camp, whose geometry allows for the unimpeded vision necessary to regulate an undifferentiated mass of individuals.</p>
				<p>For Foucault, there must also be a corresponding “mechanism that coerces by means of observation…. an apparatus in which the techniques that make it possible to see induce effects of power” and “conversely, the means of coercion [to] make those on whom they are applied clearly visible”. What’s needed are “techniques of multiple and intersecting observations, of eyes that must see without being seen” (p.171). For Foucault and many who came after, this method of observation, this surveillance, became synecdoche for the exercise of power. In order to act upon the individuals it observes, the surveilling eye must remain invisible to those it surveys.</p>
				<div class="section" id="panopticism">
					<h2>Panopticism</h2>
					<p><span class="dropcap f">F</span>or this reason, it’s helpful to approach any visual display as “a site of power inscription” (Barton and Barton, p.138). Visual scholars Barton and Barton have studied the ways graphic representations inscribe power by advantaging their viewers. According to Barton and Barton’s analysis of displays (ranging from maps, to early and modern charts, to control room interfaces), visual displays use the power of seeing-without-being-seen to advantage their viewers by creating an asymmetric power relationship.</p>
					<p>These tools allow viewers to appropriate people, places, and objects at a glance. Barton and Barton write: “seeing-without-being-seen is, in fact, the very essence of power . . . because, ultimately, the power to dominate rests on the differential possession of knowledge” (p.139). This knowledge is conveyed to observers through what the authors call the “modes of power”: that is, the synoptic and the analytic, which together combine to form the panoptic mode.</p>
					<p>Foucault writes that this technology of power arose out of necessity brought by the plague in Europe. Imposing a system of order so that “each individual is constantly located, examined, and distributed” is a response whose “function is to work out every possible confusion” (p.197) so that the living, the sick, and the dead may be known and divided accordingly. To do this, movement must be restricted and individuals and their property must be known.</p>
					<p>The transfer of knowledge from the site of its production to the central observer at the level of the state requires a system of communication, and indeed Foucault documents how the “uninterrupted work of writing links the centre and periphery” (p.197). Such a system much solve two problem, namely:
						<ol class="num-list">
							<li>“to procure for a small number, or even for a single individual, the instantaneous view of a great multitude” (p.216), and</li>
							<li>“to analyze, impose discipline, and correct behavior at the level of the individual” (Barton and Barton p.141).</li>
						</ol></p>
						<p>Barton and Barton call the former the synoptic and the latter the analytic mode, and these correspond with the macro/micro levels of design called for by Tufte and others (Barton and Barton p.??? near 146?). In addition to these two complimentary modes, Barton and Barton write, “maximal empowerment of the viewer frequently entails operation in both the synoptic and the analytic modes” (p.146) at the same time, providing a view they call panoptic, a “view that is both global and individualizing” (Foucault, 1980 p.148 as qtd. in Barton and Barton 1993, p.141).</p>
						<p>Of course, not every kind of display can convey panoptic power, and Barton and Barton, using the terminology of Jacques Bertin, as an example, distinguish between “seeing maps” and “reading maps” which, through different interface design methods, convey varying amount of power to their users. They write: “in contrast to the marks on seeing maps, however, those on reading maps generally lack the Gestalt properties needed to foster holistic perception” (p.152) and therefore only provide analytic power.</p>
						<p>The reason for this, Barton and Barton write, has to do with the method of representation used in each type of display. While seeing maps use “a graded set of concrete signs… mimetic of… their referents” (p.151), reading maps instead use abstract symbols “whose visual properties… are not mimetic of their referents” (p.152). The key difference being the method used by the maps to reference reality: seeing maps mimic reality, while reading maps do not. The ability to deploy signs that mimetically reference reality differentiates what can convey panoptic power from what cannot. This prompts us to ask: what about displays that are objectively designed to deceive?</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section" id="displays">
					<h2>Data Display</h2>
					<p><span class="dropcap s">S</span>o we have seen how all graphical displays are fundamentally deceptive in that they they allow the performance of seeing-without-being-seen that conveys to observers a power over what is observed. Elsewhere, Barton and Barton write that a visual display is deceptive in at least one other way: that it “privileges, or legitimizes certain meaning systems while at the same time dissimulates such privileging” (Barton and Barton ????, p.???). These visual displays rely on the fact that their dissimulations go undiscovered. These belong to the class of misleading visual displays discussed extensively in the literature of business and technical communication. They are comprised of display types ranging from deceptive adornment to outright visual illusion and are closely related to the dark patterns we see in contemporary interface design. Indeed, the techniques examined here are composed according to what amounts to the dark patterns of data display.</p>
					<p>Aside from the charjunk discussed by Tufte, other scholars have identified a wide range of deceptive and misleading techniques used in the creation of data displays, including techniques like improper scaling, axis changes, data omissions, and truncating. In one study published in the <em>Journal of Business and Technical Communication</em>, John Courtis (1997) examines more than 1,300 data displays contained in the annual reports of public companies in Hong Kong from 1992-1994 and finds 52% of all graphics to be misleading. Nor is he the only researcher to report such results. Raschle and Steitbart (2008) find there is “abundant evidence that the annual reports of publicly traded companies contain misleadingly designed graphs” (p.24), and they go on to cite five studies from the intervening decade that tend to support this claim.</p>
					<p>The annual reports of corporations are not the only places misleading graphs appear, of course. In Figure 1, below, we see an example of a misleading graph first published by Reuters in 2014. The chart is misleading not because of excessive decoration or 3D representation, but simply because the unconventional sequence of the y-axis, combined with unnecessary shading, strongly suggest the exact opposite conclusion than what the data actually convey. In the original chart, deaths appear to have gone down after the passage of the controversial law, but in fact they jumped just as sharply upward, as can be more easily apprehended from the revised chart at right.</p>
					<figure>
						<img alt="paired charts" src="img/misleading2.svg">
						<figcaption><strong>Figure 1</strong>: In the chart at the left, notice how the number of deaths depicted by the x-axis increase as the eye moves down the column, wheras in the chart on the right, the values increase as the eye moves upward.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Figure 2 shows another such misleading chart, one that Tufte would undoubtedly call a “duck” because “the whole structure is itself decoration” (p.116), but which is explicitly misleading as well. Nigel Holmes’s “Monstrous Costs” classic works on a number of levels to bias perception of the data. The chimerical creature dominating the visual field is repulsive as well as heavily anthropomorphized, and, used as a framing device, serves to characterize and color the data. The depiction of data bars as pointed teeth not only colors their reception, but in addition the greater area ratios of the larger values magnify the difference between data points by making them visually more salient than they would be otherwise. Finally, and most damningly, the upward slanting and concave grid lines greatly distort the perceived data values, exaggerating differences even further.</p>
					<figure>
						<img alt="Monstrous Costs" src="http://visualoop.com/media/2017/06/monster-1040x739.jpg">
						<figcaption><strong>Figure 2</strong>: In this classic duck (<a href="http://visualoop.com/media/2017/06/monster-1040x739.jpg" target="_blank">source</a>), the upward curving and concave chart area significantly exagerrates the differences between data points.</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>Tufte developed what he called the “Lie Factor” which, simply put, is equal to the “size of the effect shown in the graphic” divided by “size of the effect shown in the data” where the size of the effect is equal to the difference between two values divided by the first value. This formula yields a simple ratio whose ideal value is 1, meaning the data are perfectly represented in the chart and values greater or less than 1 describe charts that either over or under-represent the data, respectively. By calculating pixel differences using this formula, I found the “Monstrous Costs” chart to have a Lie Factor of 1.48, meaning it exaggerates differences between data points by 148%, or nearly half again as much in the final data point.</p>
					<p>For Courtis, misleading charts are those “which violated any of the five construction guidelines”, adopted somewhat idiosyncratically:
						<ol class="num-list">
							<li>“use of proper balance scales and a single zero baseline</li>
							<li>time values in a time series chart moving from left to right on the horizontal scale, or pie sectors in a descending sequence</li>
							<li>use of clear negative numbers</li>
							<li>use of creative visual effects cautiously</li>
							<li>careful choice of the number of years and number of sectors to be presented”</li>
						</ol></p>
						<p>For Tufte, it’s as simple as determining how close the Lie Factor is to the ideal value. This is essentially the same method proposed by Steinbart’s (1998) graph discrepancy index (GDI), which is just more sophisticated version of the same metric.</p>
						<p>But if it were that easy, in the case of Figure 1, how are we to evaluate the misleadingness of the chart? If we use the rubric developed by Courtis, we see it violates none of the strictures. If we use the Lie Factor developed by Tufte or the GDI created by Steinbart, the chart registers very close to the ideal of 1 because the numbers haven’t been distorted or skewed in any way, but are merely presented, and accurately at that, in an unexpected order. The chart is relying on a more fundamental kind of deception.  If we ask the chart designer to explain the choice, as one news outlet did in fact, she may simply say, as she in fact did, that the choice to reverse the axis was merely “a matter of preference” and so unconnected to the political or ideological questions raised by the design.</p>
						<p>And this may be true, for all we know. And there may be a number of other reasons for charts to be misinterpreted. Kostelnick (2008) for example identifies when readers must estimate area, volume, shading and depth, as well as when interfered with by visual noise (such as insufficient figure-ground contrast) (p. 475). At first glance, these difficulties interpreting visual inputs stem not from the deceptive intent of the designer, but from the properties of the shapes and lines themselves, the mechanism of the eyes that see, and the cognitive processes that converts sense perceptions into thought.</p>
