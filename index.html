			<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he story of the ocean goddess Mētis is less well-known than others in the Greek pantheon, but no less important inasmuch it serves as allegory for a rhetorical tradition that's been either &ldquo;neglected&rdquo; (Atwill, 1982 p.1) in or &ldquo;effaced&rdquo; (Dolmage, 201? p.?) from the histories we've canonized from Plato on down. Mētis' story contains potent lessons from which we can extract a flexible and far-reaching theory of deception that can be usefully applied across a broad range of contemporary media and that has implications for, inclusively and especially, rhetorics of science, technology, and medicine and rhetorics of feminism, multiculturalism and activism.</p>
			<p>From the &ldquo;alternative facts&rdquo; (???) of far right discourse to the &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; (???) disseminated via social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter; from the large-scale harvesting of personal data (???) to the so-called &ldquo;dark patterns&rdquo; (???) in user-experience design, rhetorical mētis has proliferated across the global communication network. Some of the reasons for this are political and societal, some appear to be related to exploitable biases in human cognition, and some are technological in nature and derive from the underlying structures that comprise media distribution at the end of the second decade of the twenty-first century.</p>
			<p>These widespread rhetorics of deceit constitute a very real danger to populations and communities to the extent they mask and enable antisocial and exploitative practices from the micro- to the macroscopic levels. Additionally, because by their very nature they obfuscate and distort, these deceptive rhetorics also compromise and co-opt other discourses ranging from the personal to the professional and this has ramifications within all levels of society.</p>
			<p>As pundits, journalists, and professional public servants alike decry a &ldquo;war on truth&rdquo; and warn of a &ldquo;constitutional crisis", an impending &ldquo;information apocalypse", as powerful new technologies emerge to harvest, analyze and broker the personal information of tens of billions of people, and as these new technologies are weaponized to accomplish cynical and divisive political agendas around the globe, liberalism and democracy need a very real defense. What's needed is a theory of rhetoric that can account for deliberate and actively deceptive techniques and that can counter and defend against them in their many guises.</p>
			<p><span class="dropcap i">I</span>n the pages that follow, I trace the historical origin of the &ldquo;particular kind of intelligence&rdquo; (D&V 11) the ancients knew as mētis in order to reclaim and situate it within our shared rhetorical tradition. Using examples drawn from contemporary digital media, including videos, tweets, information architectures, and user-interfaces, I develop an initial framework for a rhetorical theory of mētis that can be used both to interpret and to produce discourse of a deceptive nature in order to untangle nets of deception and pierce veils of disguise.</p>
			<p>Reclaiming mētis means acknowledging the explicitly moral character contemporary rhetoric has come to assume and questioning why we made this choice and what it costs us as a discipline. And perhaps it means revisiting it so as to better face new threats without compromising the virtue our allied rhetorical disciplines have rightly come to value. For rhetoricians of science, technology, and medicine especially, it means revisiting our hermeneutic turn and the role rhetoric plays in culture, while for rhetoricians of feminism, multiculturalism, and activism, it means revisiting the question of agency, what it means, and how it works in complex real-world situations characterized by (always) asymmetrical power relationships.</p>
			<p>For all of us, as writers, designers, makers, and authors of all kinds-primarily as teachers-reclaiming mētis means recommitting ourselves to civic and disciplinary obligations that have their very real expressions in the work produced by us and by our students both seen and unseen, now and into the future. Ultimately, reclaiming mētis means that we become more cunning than our most cunning adversaries, that we become more wise and more wary than the hunter, that we develop our own disguises, our own ploys, so that we may deceive the deceivers and secure the safety of us all.</p>
