				<blockquote>Our conventional response to all media, namely that it is how they are used that counts, is the numb stance of the technological idiot. For the ‘content’ of a medium is like the juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar to distract the watchdog of the mind.<cite>&mdash;McLuhan (1964, p.8)</cite></blockquote>
				<blockquote>Such is the ‘duplicity’ of mêtis which, giving itself out to be other than it is, is like those misleading objects, the powers of deception which Homer refers to as dolos: the Trojan Horse, the bed of love with its magic bonds, the fishing bait are all traps which conceal their inner deceit beneath a reassuring or seductive exterior.<cite>&mdash;Detienne and Vernant (1977, pp.23)</cite></blockquote>
			</div>
			<p><span class="dropcap i">I</span> n a recent article in <em>FastCompany</em> entitled “The Year Dark Patterns Won”, journalist Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan argues that 2016 was not only the year dark patterns metastasized on the web, it was also the year “we saw them wielded as weapons against democracy” <a href="1">(cite)</a>. Campbell-Dollaghan relates how massive internet platforms (including Twitter, Facebook, Google, Reddit, etc.) were subverted and used to systematically influence voters. At the time of this writing&mdash;midway through 2019 and just after the release of the special council’s report&mdash;we’ve a great deal of reporting has been confirmed, e.g.:</p>
			<ul class="text-list">
				<li><p>how tens of millions of Facebook users were tricked into sharing exceedingly detailed personal information with Cambridge Analytica-the social media marketing firm that worked with the GRU-run Internet Research Agency <a href="2">(cite)</a> to influence the 2016 election</p>
				</li>
				<li><p>how tens of millions of fraudulent accounts (“bots”) were mobilized by the so-called ‘Russian Troll Farm’ to disseminate fake news and to fabricate outrage on Twitter <a href="3">(cite)</a>, Reddit, and other online fora <a href="4">(cite)</a></p>
				</li>
				<li><p>and how Facebook’s and Google’s information architecture and search algorithms work to surface bogus and even fraudulent results in the form of fake news, conspiracy theories, memes and other forms of misinformation <a href="5">(cite)</a>.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Of course, these items are probably already fairly well known to readers. What makes Campbell-Dollaghan’s argument useful is the recognition even back in 2016 that this multi-faceted attack coordinated by Russian state actors fundamentally relied on dark patterns. Dark patterns (a term coined in 2010 by Henry Brignull) are used to create interfaces that deceive and exploit users, tricking them into taking harmful action. Dark patterns range from creating links that are difficult to find to various types of misdirection, disguised advertisements, and forced subscriptions, all the way to guilting users into opting into something (known as “confirmshaming”) or tricking them into publicly sharing personal information (known as “privacy Zuckering” after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg).</p>
			<p>Since the launch of <a href="http://darkpatterns.org">darkpatterns.org</a> in 2010, the topic of dark patterns steadily rose to prominence among UI/UX discourse communities before exploding into the mainstream in 2016, when stories about dark patterns appeared in a host of technology-oriented publications, including <em>Recode</em>, <em>Smashing Magazine</em>, <em>Ars Technica</em>, <em>Techcrunch</em>, <em>The Verge</em>, <em>Gizmodo</em>, <em>UX Magazine</em>, <em>UX Planet</em>, <em>UX Studio</em>, and <em>A List Apart</em>, as well as more traditional news outlets such as <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Reuters</em>, and others too numerous to list. Now dark patterns are back in the news again, this time because of bipartisan legislation known as the DETOUR Act introduced in the U.S. Senate in April of 2019. While not yet law at the time of this writing, the proposed bill would “ban large social networking platforms from using “dark patterns” to trick users into giving their consent for data collection operations” <a href=“https://www.zdnet.com/article/senators-introduce-bill-to-ban-dark-patterns-on-big-tech-platforms/">(ZDNnet)</a> as well as ordering tech platforms to create a professional standards body to work with the FTC to develop best practices for interface design.</p>
			<p>Whether or not this bill or a version of it passes into law, social media interfaces that trick users into giving away personal information are only a small part of the problem. While regulating tech giants is apparently popular enough in these polarized times to draw bipartisan political support, the proposed regulations won’t be nearly enough to counteract the potential for dark patterns to do societal harm. For one thing, the bill only targets “internet tech companies with over 100 million users” (ZDNet), meaning it doesn’t apply to 99.99% of the world’s estimated 644 million websites. Were we to include apps, games, and other interfaces designed according to dark patterns, the number of interfaces which are not affected by this law is truly countless.</p>
			<p>But there is another, more glaring, set of problems with the proposed legislation (or any bill like it), problems that designers may well grasp intuitively based on their practice, and these are the questions of how dark patterns are to be defined and how compliance is to be enforced, operationally-speaking. Where exactly is the line between dark and light design patterns? What features distinguish one from the other? Presumably it would be the job of the “professional standards body” to determine this, meaning a diverse deliberative body would need to come to consensus on an extremely slippery concept. And, as importantly, given the fact that it is just as easy to design with dark patterns as it is to design with light ones (sometimes even easier), and given the fact that designing a deceptive screen can be a really trivial task, the work of a few minutes to a few hours at most, how could any standards body, even with the resources of the FTC, possibly enforce compliance? Finally, assuming an accurate definition could be developed and applied, and assuming compliance could be enforced across the World Wide Web, how would anyone go about establishing to a satisfactory legal threshold that the intent of design was in fact to deceive users? Is it possible? Maybe. Do I find this sequence of events to be likely? Not remotely.</p>
			<p>What is needed is a solution of a different order. Legislation won’t solve the problems posed by the proliferation of dark patterns, just like legislation can’t solve the problems posed by widespread piracy of intellectual property or illicit purchases on the so-called ‘dark web’. Standards are all well and good for those who intend to act in good faith, but do little to nothing to deter bad actors, and at this time the international will does not even exist to prevent online trafficking of humans, weapons and drugs, so we mustn’t expect deceptive websites and applications to garner much attention or to command vast resources.</p>
			<p>Nor can we appeal to the users themselves in the vain hope they can curtail their most emotional responses to behavioral stimuli, nor expect them to become suddenly literate enough to detect when these patterns are being used against them-there will always be those, even among the most sophisticated, who fall victim to deception. Henry Brignull, the founder of darkpatterns.org, has adopted a staunch name-and-shame approach to call out the companies that employ dark patterns, hoping to mobilize public opinion and to encourage wholesale user migration away from platforms that employ these patterns, but three of the offenders who figure prominently on Brignull’s Wall of Shame, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, this year each reached the historical milestone of a $1 trillon valuation, so it hasn’t seemed to discourage them very much.</p>
			<p>But what if there <em>were</em> a way to curtail the use of deceptive patterns? What if they <em>could</em> effectively be banned across the World Wide Web? What would such a solution look like? How would it be instantiated? And, most importantly, how would it distinguish honest designs from dishonest ones? and how would it address the fundamental question of intent, i.e. does the interface intend to deceive, or is it merely the product of sloppy or incompetent design work? Fortunately, the first couple questions may have an answer, and relatively soon. As far back as 1995, a little known legal scholar named Paul Redienberg, in response to what he saw as the most important problem posed by the advent of digital communication technology: “the struggle over control of and access to intellectual property and personal information”, he conceived of <em>Lex Informatica</em>, the Law of Information, that, much like <em>Lex Mercatore</em> regulated trade in the age of exploration, he predicted would regulate information flows around the world in the age of the internet.</p>
			<p>Lex informatica is the idea that, rather than imposing separate legislative regulation, or relying on individuals to regulate themselves, the system as a whole should be designed and built in order to perform and enforce the regulation. With the internet, this is already possible. Each computer that connects to the internet accesses a vast network comprised of nodes that parse and pass on streams of information. Much of this traffic is encrypted of course, and therefore opaque to anyone without the decryption keys, but much of it is not. And even encrypted traffic is not perfectly meaningless, as much can be determined from analysis of traffic patterns and other sophisticated tools. Much as malware can be detected and quarantined by web browsers, by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), by search engines, and by anti-virus software, and much as YouTube can scan billions of videos and pull those with IP-infringing content, so too could dark patterns, were they rendered detectible, be excluded from the majority of the web’s traffic.</p>
			<p>But unfortunately, it is the final pair of questions that are most problematic. How can we distinguish a deceptive design from a honest one? And, if we could, how could we then determine whether the designer intended to deceive or was merely practicing poor design?</p>
			<p>It is precisely these questions that the discipline of rhetoric is most suited to answer, for rhetoric and deception have a very long, very entangled history, and perhaps no field of study has a better understanding of deception than does Rhetoric. If we had a real rhetoric of deception it could help us determine, for instance, if deception is more likely than not in a given case. It could work as a kind of detector to help people determine with some degree of likelihood if they are being misled.</p>
			<p>At first it may seem there is no rhetoric of deception, nor could there be. Deception is an anti-rhetoric: they are faces of the same coin. Rhetoric is almost by definition, and most certainly by tradition, the art of <em>ethical</em> persuasion, whereas all other types of persuasion could simply be called deception. I am not being solipsistic when I say that a rhetoric of deception would simply be the rhetoric of rhetoric. This is the point Booth is trying to make, in his recent (2009) work of that name, by calling deceptive rhetorics “Rhetrickery”. Rhetoric has long been entwined with deception, and teasing them apart is a difficult challenge. Nevertheless, should we persist, we may emerge from this discussion with the tools we need to both distinguish deceptive patterns from their more benevolent siblings as well as find a solution to the problem of intent.</p>
			<p>In discourse of rhetoric and composition, the design of interfaces has been subject to rigorous study. After all, interfaces are by their nature persuasive, multimodal, context-dependent, and audience-oriented - in other words, profoundly rhetorical. Indeed, an array of research over the past thirty years has attended explicitly to these characteristics of interfaces, in operating systems (Selfe and Selfe, 1991?), in email (Moran, 1995), in word-processors (Selfe, 1989), and in data displays (Kostelnick, 2007). The best studies manage to ground interfaces firmly within wider human experience, and thus can provide a much-needed critical dimension to the discourse found on design blogs and social media. Those authors listed above, plus Spinuzzi (2001), Johnson-Eilola (2004), Wysocki and Jasken (2004), Warnick (2005), Potts (2009), Arola (2010), and others too numerous to list, have contributed significantly to the study of interface design and human experience, in more or less explicitly rhetorical terms.</p>
			<p>This present study examines a special kind of interface, the kind that’s been designed to deceive its audience. Created according to what are known as “dark patterns”, such interfaces employ a wide array of tactics to dupe, swindle, and defraud their users. Despite Rhetoric’s long preoccupation with deceit and our more recent attention to interface design, dark patterns haven’t been studied in depth by rhetorical scholars; indeed, their emergence and rapid proliferation has gone nearly unremarked (with the notable exception of Trice and Potts, 2018). But dark patterns are deeply instructive for those who wish to better understand the particular kind of visual-experiential rhetoric they perform, as well as those who wish to better understand rhetoric and deception more generally.</p>
			<p>Dark patterns provide relatively discrete instances in which malicious actors exploit perceptual *lacunae* (of which we are typically unaware); dark patterns constitute the extreme case when human interpretation fails spectacularly. But, rather than show us our limits, they instead show us our potential. Perhaps paradoxically, dark patterns illuminate the very means by which reality is constructed––for we do not experience reality as it is, but rather quite literally as we think it ought to be, based on available evidence and past experience. Dark patterns show us that what we commonly refer to as reality, visual reality at least, is instead an almost-invisibly constructed simulation, an illusion we perpetrate on ourselves, and, furthermore, it is this illusion of reality that ultimately makes deception––indeed, perhaps all persuasion––possible.</p>
			<p>This argument relies on the visual rhetorical analysis of the class of interfaces composed according to dark patterns, as well as related cases in the discourse of visual studies, to show the fundamental disassociation between perception and reality I’m describing. By synthesizing the sprawling set of semiotic terms and pseudo-rhetorical concepts collectively known to the ancients as <em>mêtis</em>, or cunning intelligence, I attempt to ground this understanding of interfaces in human experience. As Atwill, Dolmage, Hawhee, and Kopelson have separately argued, <em>mêtis</em> is part of a neglected (or deliberately effaced) rhetorical tradition closely related to venerable concepts such as <em>techn</em>, <em>dissoi logoi</em>, <em>kairos</em>, <em>copia</em>, and others.</p>
			<p><em>Mêtis</em>, or rhetorical cunning as these scholars have called it, provides a way not only to understand dark patterns and online deception more broadly, but also to understand an aspect of rhetoric we only periodically confront: namely, the legacy that identifies rhetoric with deceit, with perfidy, with lies, the kind Booth (2009) calls “rhetrickery” (p.?) and which has relentlessly dogged our steps since our earliest histories. The study of <em>mêtis</em> and dark patterns is potentially redemptive, because, in the end, rhetoric is our best defense against dark patterns, and, in a time when fake news, alternative facts and information warfare are proliferating rapidly, we need it now more than ever.</p>
