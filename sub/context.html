			<h2>Design Patterns and Antipatterns</h2>
			<p><span class="dropcap i">I</span>n design discourse, a design pattern is an abstract solution to a common problem that can be used over and over in different contexts. In their now legendary urban planning text, A Pattern Language, Alexander et al. (1977) write that a design pattern “describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing the same thing twice” (p. 10).</p>
			<p>For example, in interface design, a dropdown list is a pattern that solves the problem of presenting too much information at once. When abstracted, it can be reused in variety of situations, from presenting a list of menu items to unveiling entire control panels. But, abstraction can itself be a problem, as is the case with antipatterns. According to Brown et. al (1998) in their eponymous text, “a design pattern becomes an AntiPattern when it causes more problems than it solves” (p.2).</p>
			<p>The authors go on to write antipatterns “may be the result of a manager or developer not knowing any better, not having sufficient knowledge or experience in solving a particular type of problem, or having applied a perfectly good pattern in the wrong context” (p.6). For example, if the dropdown list only holds one item (instead of several), it’s an antipattern and it requires more effort from users than it saves them.</p>
			<p>When Harry Brignull (2013) defines a dark pattern as “a user interface carefully crafted to trick users,” he’s conflating two things we should tease apart. Dark patterns are not, strictly speaking, the interfaces themselves. If patterns are abstracted solutions that can be used in new contexts, then we could say more properly that deceptive interfaces are designed (or composed) according to dark patterns; they are not the patterns themselves. An individual interface might conform to a pattern or not, it might reveal traces of a pattern or even patterns, but it is not the pattern itself, instead it is its artifact.</p>
			<p class="filligree"><span class="pinwheel">&#10050;</span><span class="pinwheel">&#10050;</span><span class="pinwheel">&#10050;</span></p>
			<p><span class="dropcap d">D</span>esign patterns, dark or light, can generate different interfaces like recipes can generate different dishes, each for a similar but slightly different purpose, each with similar but slightly different ingredients. Deceptive interfaces are the manifestations of the dark patterns, are the result of them, and so, and this is important, we can see in their workings the impression made by the pattern’s structure and thus infer its likely features and characteristics, even though these are written nowhere.</p>
			<p>The dark patterns used to generate deceptive interfaces, at least the kind typically posted with the #darkpatterns hashtag on Twitter, comprise the middle section of a whole spectrum of communicative deception (see Figure ##) ranging from the highly personal at one end, such as a lie told to your face, to the highly abstract on the other end, such as a lie told with a badly formatted axis on a graph hastily included in a news broadcast. The deceptive interfaces posted to the #darkpatterns hashtag, like those on either side of it on the spectrum, often consist both of content elements (broadly speaking) and of design elements (again broadly), working in consort.</p>
			<p>In the example of Figure ##, the content elements (the meaning of the words, the meaning of the shoe and the hair) and the design elements (they layout, the shadow on the hair and its resultant depth) work together to create an illusion that conceals a trap. By the same token, though in a different way, in Figure 2, in a quite typical bit of unsubscribe-link trickery, the content elements, i.e. the words and the links, are confused by the design elements (the color and underlining). In this way, the true link is disguised so it cannot be clicked easily. In both cases, content and design elements work simultaneously to effect the deception and in both examples this is happening somewhere between an actual person lying to your face and, say, a number being exaggerated by a chart.</p>

				<h2>Online Deception and Anonymity</h2>
				<p>To one side of dark patterns, we can call it the interpersonal side sit various kinds of online deception  that rely on lies told by people to one another, dating to the earliest days of networked communication. These are typically promulgated by individuals or very small groups for straightforward gain and include trolling and catfishing, but also include phishing and spear-phishing operations that rely on faked emails and stolen identities.</p>
				<p>The early computer mediated deceptions occurred in MUDs (multi-user domains) and UseNet groups (electronic mailing lists, essentially), as these were the first “virtual communities” (Donath, 1997 p.11) where people took on alternate identities and played various social roles like the ‘celebrity’, the ‘newbie’, and the ‘lurker’ (Golder and Donath 2004, p.???). One of the roles Golder and Donath describe is the troll, a “master of identity deception”, who is “adept at understanding and using the styles of speech a community deems acceptable, so as to not appear as an outsider.”</p>
				<p>This allows him to conceal “his identity as a Troll and therefore his true motive is not known until it is too late” (p.18). Trolls can thrive inasmuch as they can blend in. Golder and Donath note “the more competence one has in the register of the community, the easier one will be able to identify a Troll’s deviant behavior” (p.18). Once exposed, a troll is powerless. Their disguise is everything.</p>
				<p class="filligree"><span class="pinwheel">&#10050;</span><span class="pinwheel">&#10050;</span><span class="pinwheel">&#10050;</span></p>
				<p><span class="dropcap c">C</span>atfishing, another related type of online deception, is the act of assuming the specific identity of another person, real or fictional, such as in the Manti Te’o Hoax, in which a college football player suffered the death of his longtime girlfriend who never existed (Burke and Dickey, 2013, p.??).</p>
				<p>This practice also dates to the earliest days of networked communication with the case of Joan Sue Green, a neuropsychologist in her late twenties who had been disfigured, rendered mute, and badly disabled in a car accident that had killed her boyfriend. Over a period of two years beginning in 1981, Joan, in the MUDs she frequented, “became a monumental on-line presence who served both as a support for other disabled women and as an inspiring stereotype-smasher to the able-bodied.”</p>
				<p>But Joan, it turns out, did not actually exist; she’d been fabricated whole-cloth by a man, a prominent New York psychologist, as part of a “bizarre, all-consuming experiment to… experience the intimacy of female friendships” (Van Gelder,  1985, p.365). This story ultimately turns tragic, as the psychologist lured ‘Joan’s’ female friends into sexual relationships and exploited them (p.372) until, noticing “inconsistencies in her persona”, one of ‘Joan’s’ online friends confronted him, extracted a confession, and outed him to the community. Once unmasked, he was powerless.</p>

				</figure>
				<p>	All of these deceptions are enabled by ubiquitous anonymity, the primary affordance of the internet we’ve built. As the venerable New Yorker cartoon had it as far back as 1989, “on the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog” (Figure ##). Today, it is but a moment’s work to gain anonymity such that will defeat all but the most sophisticated inspection, beyond the reach of most people. With this anonymity comes power. In his chapter on the panopticon in Discipline and Punish, Foucault writes that the ability to “dissimulate… to see without being seen” (???) is the foremost “technology of power” (???) shaping human history.</p>
				<p>The ability to see without being seen conveys power through “the differential possession of knowledge” (Barton and Barton ???), visual rhetoricians tell us. To craft such a disguise is precisely to dissimulate, to pretend to be other than you are. This ability is also one of the main characteristics of the kind of intelligence the ancients called mētis, and it is the operating principle behind all dark patterns. As we shall see, the fact that all these deceptive tactics rely on dissimulation is not coincidence: instead, it is their defining characteristic and it contains the mechanism by which their deception is effected.</p>

				<h2>Deceptive Graphics and Modes of Power</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap o">O</span>n the other side of dark patterns sit an array of presentational methods used to distort, disguise, and otherwise misrepresent data, primarily by optical means. Scholars have identified a variety of techniques, including improper scaling, axis changes, data omissions, and truncation, among others. In one study, John Courtis (1997) examines more than 1,300 data displays contained in the annual reports and finds 52% of all graphics to be misleading (p.??).</p>
				<p>Nor are his the only such results. Raschle and Steitbart (2008) find “abundant evidence that the annual reports of publicly traded companies contain misleadingly designed graphs” (p.24). We also find misleading charts in the public sphere. Figure ## shows one from 2014 which uses unconventional y-axis sequencing and unnecessary shading to completely reverse the conclusion one draws from the data. Scholars have attempted various ways to measure deceptive graphs, such as Tufte’s “lie factor” (p.52), and Steinbart’s (1998) “graph discrepancy index”, but the chart in the figure would match the ideal ratio of 1 in either measuring system.</p>
				<p>Finally, Kostelnick (2008) identifies places when readers must estimate area, volume, shading and depth, as well as when interfered with by visual noise (such as insufficient figure-ground contrast) (p. 475) as additional concerns in data visualization, and this indicates there is some optical mechanism operating here.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="../assets/img/misleading2.svg" alt="Misleading Chart">
					<figcaption>Figure ##: In the chart, notice how the number of deaths depicted by the y-axis increase as the eye moves down the column. This is the fundamental deception/reversal. (source of image).</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he concept of chartjunk, a term coined by Tufte (1983), applies to a category of misleading graphics characterized by excessive decoration. For Tufte, chartjunk has three types: “unintentional optic art”, “the grid”, and “the duck.” Tufte writes of chartjunk it “comes cheaper than the hard work required to produce intriguing numbers and secure evidence” (p. 107).</p>
				<p>Although sometimes caused by the designer’s understandable impulse to “enliven the display” (p.107), chartjunk has real deceptive potential, Tufte notes, when he writes it can be employed to “make the graphic appear more scientific and precise” (p.107), that “the noise clouds the information flow” (p.108), and the use of a grid “camouflages the profile of the data” (p.113). He uses words like “phoney”, “fake” (p.118) and “false” (p.121) to characterize it. The name itself is highly pejorative.</p>
				<p>Figure ## shows a chart that Tufte would undoubtedly call a duck because “the whole structure is itself decoration” (p.116), and which is explicitly misleading as well. The chimerical creature dominating the visual field is repulsively anthropomorphized, the chart axis shamelessly concave, and the triangular data bars magnify differences by making larger values exponentially more salient.</p>
				<p>Tufte’s pronouncement on chartjunk has finality, it is “bad art and bad data graphics” (p.108) and deserves no place in scientific, technical, and professional communication. As Kostelnick (2008) points out, if the “gold standard of data design [is] clarity” (p.116), of telling the most with the least amount of ink, of telling the truth with the data, than chartjunk is antithetical.</p>

					<figcaption>Figure ##: Nigel Holmes’s “Monstrous Costs” classic works on a number of levels to bias perception of the data.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p><span class="dropcap w">W</span>hile Tufte can dispense with ideology in data graphics, other visual scholars find it helpful to approach data display as “a site of power inscription” (Barton and Barton, p.138). Barton and Barton describe data displays such as maps and control rooms which privilege viewers and allow them to appropriate people, places and objects at a glance.</p>
				<p>To do so, the authors rely on a Foucauldian understanding of power and a surveillance developed out of necessity during the time of the plague. It ensures “each individual is constantly located, examined, and distributed” and its “function is to work out every possible confusion” (p.197) so that the living, the sick, and the dead may be known and divided accordingly. Communication bridges this transition, as Foucault describes how the “uninterrupted work of writing links the centre and periphery” (p.197).</p>
				<p>Such a system solves two problems, namely: “to procure for a small number, or even for a single individual, the instantaneous view of a great multitude” (p.216), and “to analyze, impose discipline, and correct behavior at the level of the individual” (Barton and Barton p.141). Barton and Barton call these synoptic and the analytic modes of power, respectively. However, for the “maximal empowerment of the viewer frequently entails operation in both the synoptic and the analytic modes” (p.146), they can be combined into the panoptic mode, a “view that is both global and individualizing”  (Foucault, 1980 p.148 as qtd. in Barton and Barton 1993, p.141).</p>
				<p>For Foucault, this is the corresponding “mechanism that coerces by means of observation…. an apparatus in which the techniques that make it possible to see induce effects of power” and “conversely, the means of coercion [to] make those on whom they are applied clearly visible”. These ways of seeing are “techniques of multiple and intersecting observations, of eyes that must see without being seen” (p.171 emphasis added).</p>
				<p>Thus surveillance becomes synecdoche for the exercise of power and to do its work, the appropriating gaze must dissimulate. As Barton and Barton write: “seeing-without-being-seen is, in fact, the very essence of power . . . because, ultimately, the power to dominate rests on the differential possession of knowledge” (p.139).</p>

				<h3>Dark Patterns Dissimulate</h3>
				<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he closest relatives of dark patterns, online deception on one side and optical distortion on the other, both share the feature of dissimulation.  It is a feature that the deceptive interfaces we’ll study in the remainder of this article also share. In fact, it is investigating the nature of dissimulation that leads us in two, initially divergent directions that eventually converge in dark patterns. To dissimulate means to effect a disguise, and this has both rhetorical and visual components. All dark patterns rely on some type of disguise, as we shall see. First, we’ll investigate rhetorical disguise, then visual disguise, before synthesizing them in the case analyses to follow.</p>
