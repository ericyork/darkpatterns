				<h2>Aspects of Mētis</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap a">A</span>ccording to the legends of Hesiod and Ovid, the goddess Mētis was the daughter of Tethys and first wife to Zeus. Her story is perhaps not as well-known as others in the pantheon, but Mētis authored the ploy by which Zeus bested Chronos and thus began the Olympian age. As an ocean goddess, Mētis was a shapeshifter and her divine portfolio included counsel, wisdom, and trickery.</p>
				<p>Her final fate was betrayal. Zeus, foreseeing that her progeny would one day overthrow him, tricked Mētis into assuming the form of a fly and swallowed her, consuming her power and becoming “himself pure <em>mētis</em>" (Detienne and Vernant, 1972 p.14). From then on, no god or group of gods would overthrow him because “not a single cunning trick can be plotted in the universe without first passing through his mind” (p.14).</p>
				<p>But Mētis was pregnant when Zeus swallowed her; the unborn child did not perish and eventually sprang from Zeus’ brow “fully formed and equipped with the arms of war” (Hesiod). Athena, chief goddess and patron of the arts, became an important mythical figure in Ancient Greece. Whether advising Odysseus in the stratagems of war or teaching artisans her <em>tēchne pantoie</em>, the “art of many facets” (Detienne and Vernant p.18), Athena perhaps most directly inherited the gifts of Mētis that Zeus had tried to keep for himself.</p>
				<p>To proceed, we must partially recover what Janet Atwill calls a “neglected tradition of rhetoric embodied . . . in Protagoras’ political techne and Isocrates’ logon techne and preserved, in somewhat modified form in Aristotle’s Rhetoric” (1), in particular the kind of cunning intelligence known as <em>mētis</em>.</p>
				<p><span class="dropcap i">I</span>n Atwill’s history, techne is interwoven with <em>mētis</em>. As “counsel personified” (OCD as qtd. In Atwill p. 50), Mētis the goddess is connected with rhetorical theories of prudentia, prudence, and decorum, as well as with the conceptual field of phronesis, or practical wisdom. Atwill describes how <em>mētis</em> enables techne. It’s the cunning mind which empowers the weaker to subvert the stronger in the animal world and which gives rise to stratagems like the Trojan Horse (p.56) whose reassuring exterior hides a lethal inner character.</p>
				<p>Atwill’s analysis of <em>mētis</em> focuses on its transformational power. She writes, “the significance of techne often lies in the power of transformation <em>mētis</em> provides” (56). This is because, in the shifting realm, only that which can change more fluidly than its circumstances can succeed. Other scholars studying <em>mētis</em> also emphasize its physical, embodied character, such as Hawhee (2002) in discussing educational discipline (p.150), and Dolmage (2009) in discussing rhetorical tradition (p.??).</p>
				<p>Likewise, others, have noted <em>mētis</em>’s transformative power, such as Kopelson (2003), who finds it in the “camouflaging or polymorphic capabilities of various animals who blend with and adapt to their surroundings for survival” (p.131).</p>
				<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he core text on <em>mētis</em> is Detienne and Vernant’s (1978) monograph Cunning Intelligence in Greek Culture and Society, a sprawling semiotic map covering fourteen centuries in search of “coherent body of mental attitudes and intellectual behaviour” that is “conspicuous by its absence.” “There is no text which reveals straightforwardly its fundamental characteristics and its origins” (p.3) they write, before presenting just that. For Detienne and Vernant, <em>mētis</em> is</p>
				<blockquote class="inline-quote">flair, wisdom, forethought, subtlety of mind, deception, resourcefulness, vigilance, opportunism, various skills, and experience acquired over the years. It is applied to situations which are transient, shifting, disconcerting. and ambiguous, situations which do not lend themselves to precise measurement, exact calculation or rigorous logic (p.4).</blockquote>
				<p><!-- provides spacing below blockquote, fix this!!!--> </p>
				<p>While the ploys of cunning are many, Detienne and Vernant identify four essential aspects of <em>mētis</em>:  1) it allows the weaker to overcome the stronger; 2) it involves seizing an awaited-for opportunity; 3) it takes many forms and has various expedients, and 4) it pretends to be the opposite of what it is. As Detienne and Vernant write: “the only way to triumph over an adversary endowed with <em>mētis</em> is to turn its own weapons against it” (p.43).</p>
				<p>As we shall see, each of these aspects has a rhetorical counterpart that represents mastery of that aspect. Every aspect, that is, except the final one, which has no rhetorical cognate. It is this fourth and final aspect upon which we will focus, for it is in fact the essence of deceit itself: dissimulation.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="dissoi">
				<h2><em>Mētis</em> and <em>Dissoi Logoi</em></h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he first characteristic of <em>mētis</em> is that it’s used to overturn superior power in a contest, so the weaker can overcome the stronger. For example, in the chariot race, in Book 23 of the Illiad, Antilochus, possessed of slower horses, is able to overcome Menelaus by a trick (<em>dolos</em>).</p>
				<p>Detienne and Vernant write: “his <em>mētis</em> as a driver conceives a maneuver which is more or less a cheat and which enables him to reverse an unfavorable situation and to triumph over competitors who are stronger than he is” (p.12). They go on to write,
					<blockquote class="inline-quote">In every confrontation or competitive situation&mdash;whether the adversary be a man, an animal or a natural force&mdash;success can be won by two means, either thanks to a superiority in power in the particular sphere in which the contest is taking place, with the stronger gaining the victory; or by the use of methods of a different order whose effect is, precisely, to reverse the natural outcome of the encounter and to allow victory to fall to the party whose defeat had appeared inevitable (p.13).</blockquote>
				<p><!-- provides spacing below blockquote, fix this!!!--> </p>
				<p>This characteristic is clearly related to the rhetorical concept of dissoi logoi, the method of “counterveilling arguments” or arguing both sides of an issue (also known by the names in utrumque partes and dialexis). Atwill explains “the sophistic techne of dissoi logoi,” like “the pulley” of a mechanical contrivance, enables “the ‘smaller’ to overcome the ‘larger’” (p.72).</p>
				<p>In speech, in sophistry, the skilled speaker may, as Aristotle puts it, make “the worse argument seem the better” (Bizzel and Herzberg, 2001 p. 235), or as Detienne and Vernant put it, “by means of his skill and rhetorical ploys, the sophist can make the weaker argument triumph over the stronger” (p. 45).</p>
				<p>This blurs the line, Atwill notes, between the human and the mechanical (p.73). When the pulley, through an amazing reversal, is able to cause the lighter to outweigh the more massive, the mind is momentarily confused: “it appears as the strangest, most baffling thing in the world” (Dettiene and Vernant, 1978, p.46), aporia (without expedient) and “the state of mind that is provoked by the equal force of contrary arguments” (p.303). In this moment of <em>aporia</em>, as contrary arguments turn, cunning takes advantage.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="kairos">
				<h2><em>Mētis</em> and <em>Kairos</em></h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap s">S</span>o the second essential characteristic of <em>mētis</em> is its vigilant opportunism, and <em>kairos</em> is its rhetorical counterpart. This aspect of <em>mētis</em> is closely related to “the term kairos, opportunity,” Detienne and Vernant note, “although in a form which we must define more closely” (p. 15). The kind the authors mean is not mere recognition of the kairic moment, but rather mastery over it.</p>
				<p>Detienne and Vernant write <em>mētis</em> “can seize the opportunity in as much as… it has been able to foresee how events will turn out and to prepare itself for this well in advance” (p.16). Thus, acting with <em>mētis</em> means learning from the past, inhabiting the present, and manipulating the future beforehand.</p>
				<p>This union of space with time is captured in the rhetorical concept of <em>kairos</em>, which, after long neglect, has enjoyed a revival in recent decades in theories related to agency (Herndl and Licona, 2004), religion (Crosby, 2011), and the rhetoric of science (Miller, 2013), among others.</p>
				<p>Much of modern rhetorical conceptions of the term are drawn from Sippiora and Baumlin (2002) and ultimately from E.C White (1987), who derives the roots of the word from both archery and weaving, describing kairos as “a passing instant when an opening appears which must be driven through with force if success is to be achieved” (p.13).</p>
				<p>The metaphor of an opening, a window of time, and the movement necessary to clear it, whether by arrow or shuttle, again blurs the distinction between the mechanical and the discursive, allowing the archer, the weaver, or the rhetor to overtake the swiftly passing moment, as Detienne and Vernant write, “It is <em>mētis</em> which, overtaking the kairos, however fleeting it may be, catches it by surprise” (p.16).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="copia">
				<h2><em>Mētis</em> and <em>Copia</em></h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>o catch even <em>kairos</em> by surprise, one must already be in the right position, and thus the third essential characteristic of <em>mētis</em>, polymorphism, has as its rhetorical counterpart <em>copia</em>, or, as Erasmus put it more fully: <em>duplici copia verborum ac rerum</em>, the duofold abundance of words and ideas. Detienne and Vernant explain <em>mētis</em> “is not one, not unified, but multiple and diverse . . . never at a loss, never without expedients (poroi) to get . . . out of any kind of trouble” (p.18).</p>
				<p>This quality, polutropos, ‘many-turning’ or crooked, is identified by Sippiora (2002) as “the special rhetorical ability to invent language appropriate to specific classes of listeners” (p.4). In a speech or debate, circumstances may shift and the speaker must improvise.</p>
				<p>In Institutes of Oratory, Quintillian, noting this provisional nature, writes of rhetorical rules, they “must generally be altered to suit the nature of each individual case, the time, the occasion, and necessity itself; consequently, one great quality in an orator is discretion, because he must turn his thoughts in various directions, according to different bearings of his subject” (p.383).</p>
				<p>This improvisation can only be accomplished by having ready to hand a copious storehouse of knowledge on a variety of topics. Quintillian writes how “an orator ought to be furnished, above all things, with an ample store of examples” (p.423) so the “orator, therefore, know as many as possible of every kind” (p.424).</p>
				<p>Erasmus echoes this, writing the “ultimate goal” of copia is “to equip a rhetor so that he can improvise as the occasion demands” (p.583). The ability to shift in response to circumstance is enabled by knowledge that is various and multiple, and, like the others aspects of <em>mētis</em>, is well-preserved in rhetorical tradition.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section" id="snare">
				<h2><em>Mētis</em> and the Snare</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he fourth characteristic of <em>mētis</em> has no obvious rhetorical cognate; it is the essence of deceit: the power of disguise. Dettiene and Vernant write: “In <em>mētis</em> appearance and reality no longer correspond to one another but stand in contrast, producing an effect of illusion, <em>apate</em>, which beguiles the adversary into error and leaves him as bemused by his defeat as by the spells of a magician” (p. 21).</p>
				<p>When the sophist, endowed with <em>mētis</em>, practices this art, he becomes a “living trap” (p.40) or “living bond” (p.41) who ensnares his listeners in “the glittering web of his words” (p.22). In the oft-cited rejection of sophistry in Gorgias, when rhetoric is denigrated as flattery, as merely the “counterpart of cookery in the soul” (p.98), Plato takes aim explicitly at such arts of disguise, writing:</p>
				<blockquote class="inline-quote">cookery is flattery disguised as medicine; and in just the same manner self-adornment personates gymnastic: with its rascally, deceitful, ignoble, and illiberal nature it deceives men by forms and colors, polish and dress, so as to make them, in the effort of assuming an extraneous beauty, neglect the native sort (emphasis added, p.98).</blockquote>
				<p>We see it also in Phedrus, as Socrates educates his pupil in the arts of persuasion, disguise is implicit to the discussion of “resemblances”. Plato writes, “then he who is to deceive another, and is not to be deceived himself, must know accurately the similarity and dissimilarity of things” (p.158). Being able to distinguish “the real nature of things” (p.158) is important precisely because it allows both the perpetration and the penetration of disguise.</p>
				<p>As Detienne and Vernant write “Being on the watch for anything that might happen is a way of being able to forestall the cunning tricks of an enemy and to devise, in advance, ways of trapping him in his own net” (p.311). This is why, when Plato discusses deceit, he speaks of the ability to deceive and the ability to avoid deception together: they are both aspects of the same intelligence: the capacity to make one thing look like another.</p>
				<h2>Mechanical Production</h2>
				<p>What these have in common is an emphasis on the mechanical. Rather than the arrow aiming for the chink in the armor, or the hand clearing the shuttle on the loom, the techne of <em>mētis</em> is instead like using a lever and pully to pry open a gap. Mētis uses a physical process to generate mechanical advantage.</p>
