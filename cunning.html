			<h2>Mêtis</h2>
			<p><span class="dropcap a">A</span>ccording to the legends of Hesiod and Ovid, the goddess Mêtis was the daughter of Tethys and first wife to Zeus. Her story is perhaps not as well-known as others in the pantheon, but Mêtis authored the ploy by which Zeus bested Chronos and thus began the Olympian age. As an ocean goddess, Mêtis was a shapeshifter and her divine portfolio included counsel, wisdom, and trickery. Her final fate was betrayal. Zeus, foreseeing that her progeny would one day overthrow him, tricked Mêtis into assuming the form of a fly and swallowed her, consuming her power and becoming “himself pure <em>mētis</em>" (Detienne and Vernant, 1972 p.14). From then on, no god or group of gods would overthrow him because “not a single cunning trick can be plotted in the universe without first passing through his mind” (p.14).</p>
			<p>But Mêtis was pregnant when Zeus swallowed her; the unborn child did not perish and eventually sprang from Zeus’ brow “fully formed and equipped with the arms of war” (Hesiod). Athena, chief goddess and patron of the arts, became an important mythical figure in Ancient Greece. Whether advising Odysseus in the stratagems of war or teaching artisans her <em>tēchne pantoie</em>, the “art of many facets” (Detienne and Vernant p.18), Athena perhaps most directly inherited the gifts of Mētis that Zeus had tried to keep for himself.</p>
			<p>In her groundbreaking history of <em>techne</em>, <em>Rhetoric Reclaimed</em>, Janet Atwill aims to recover the “neglected tradition of rhetoric embodied . . . in Protagoras’ political <em>techne</em> and Isocrates’ <em>logon techne</em> and preserved, in somewhat modified form in Aristotle’s Rhetoric” (1). For Atwill, the history of <em>techne</em> is interwoven with that of <em>mêtis</em>, and the terms often co-occur. In Atwill’s retelling, as “counsel personified” (OCD as qtd. In Atwill p. 50), <em>mêtis</em> is connected with rhetorical theories of <em>prudentia</em>, prudence, or decorum, as well as with the conceptual field of <em>phronesis</em>, or practical wisdom. Like other kinds of knowledge concerning “things which could be otherwise,” (Aristotle? p.???) <em>phronesis</em>, <em>techne</em>, and <em>mêtis</em> all operate within shifting and ambiguous circumstances where outcomes are uncertain and opportunities appear and swiftly disappear.
			</p>
			<p>Atwill argues that <em>mêtis</em> is the kind of intelligence useful to both the hunter and the rhetor, for it enables techne. It’s the cunning which empowers the weaker to subvert the stronger in the animal world and which gives rise to stratagems like the Trojan Horse (p.56) whose reassuring exterior hides a lethal inner character. As with mêtis the goddess, Atwill’s analysis of mêtis the concept focuses extensively on its transformational power. She writes, “the significance of <em>techne</em> often lies in the power of transformation <em>mêtis</em> provides” (56). This is because, in the shifting realm, only that which can change more fluidly than its circumstances can survive.</p>
			<div class="section" id="aspects">
				<h2>Aspects of Mêtis</h2>
				<p><span class="dropcap w">W</span>hile the ploys of cunning are many, Detienne and Vernant identify four essential aspects, or characteristics, of <em>mêtis</em> that underlie all its manifestations. The relationships between these characteristics and various rhetorical terms are complex and will need closer examination, and to a great extent each of these characteristics is interrelated with the others, but in brief, <em>mêtis</em>:
					<ol class="num-list">
						<li>allows the weaker to overcome the stronger;</li>
						<li>involves seizing an awaited-for opportunity;</li>
						<li>takes many forms and has various expedients;</li>
						<li>pretends to be the opposite of what it is.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>As we examine each of these characteristics in more depth, I attempt to articulate them explicitly with a series of rhetorical counterparts. These characteristics and their rhetorical pairs will comprise the four-cornered net by which we can identify <em>mêtis</em>, for, as Detienne and Vernant write: “the only way to triumph over an adversary endowed with <em>mêtis</em> is to turn its own weapons against it” (p.43). Thus, to counter the clouds of <em>mêtis</em> that deceive our senses, we must create our own deceptive cloud, in the form of this net, to trap it in whatever form it takes. More prosaically, I mean to say I hope these characteristics of <em>mêtis</em> and their rhetorical counterparts can serve as an analytic framework to identify and denaturalize the dark patterns we’ll encounter in the cases examined here.</p>
			</div>
				<div class="section" id="dissoi">
					<h2><em>Mêtis</em> and <em>Dissoi Logoi</em></h2>
					<p><span class="dropcap i">I</span>The first characteristic of <em>mêtis</em> is that it’s used so the weaker in a given context may overcome the stronger. According to Detienne and Vernant, <em>mêtis</em> stands opposed to superior power and provides an alternates means to victory. They write,
						<blockquote class="inline-quote">In every confrontation or competitive situation&mdash;whether the adversary be a man, an animal or a natural force&mdash;success can be won by two means, either thanks to a superiority in power in the particular sphere in which the contest is taking place, with the stronger gaining the victory; or by the use of methods of a different order whose effect is, precisely, to reverse the natural outcome of the encounter and to allow victory to fall to the party whose defeat had appeared inevitable (p.13).</blockquote>
					</p>
					<p>As an example, Detienne and Vernant examine the chariot race in Book 23 of the <em>Illiad</em> in which Antilochus, possessed of slower horses, is able to overcome Menelaus by a trick (<em>dolos</em>). Detienne and Vernant write: “his <em>mêtis</em> as a driver conceives a maneuver which is more or less a cheat and which enables him to reverse an unfavorable situation and to triumph over competitors who are stronger than he is” (p.12). This particular moment illustrates not only how <em>mêtis</em> outweighs other factors, but also how the victory supplied by such cunning is often fraught. <em>mêtis</em> can be interpreted in two opposite ways: either as a brilliant method to overcome the odds, or as a dirty trick, “the despised weapon of . . . cowards” (p.13).</p>
					<p>It is no coincidence that this characteristic is so closely related to the rhetorical concept known as the <em>dissoi logoi</em>, the method of “counterveilling arguments” or arguing both sides of an issue (also known as <em>in utrumque partes</em> and <em>dialexis</em>). Atwill explains “the sophistic <em>techne</em> of <em>dissoi logoi</em>” (p.72), like the pulley of a mechanical contrivance, allows the force of the smaller to overcome that of the larger. In speech, the skilled speaker may, as Aristotle put it in his <em>Rhetoric</em>, make “the worse argument seem the better” (Bizzel and Herzberg, 2001 p. 235), or as Detienne and Vernant put it, “by means of his skill and rhetorical ploys, the sophist can make the weaker argument triumph over the stronger” (p. 45).</p>
					<p>This blurs the line, Atwill notes (p.73) between the human and the mechanical. When the pulley, through an amazing reversal, is able to cause the lighter to outweigh the more massive, the mind is momentarily confused: “it appears as the strangest, most baffling thing in the world” (p.46) Dettienne and Vernant call it, <em>aporia</em> (without expedient) and “the state of mind that is provoked by the equal force of contrary arguments” (p.303). The source of the surprise is that what is expected doesn’t occur, instead its opposite does. And in this moment of <em>aporia</em>, cunning takes advantage.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section" id="kairos">
					<h2>Mêtis and <em>Kairos</em></h2>
					<p><span class="dropcap s">S</span>o the second essential characteristic of <em>mêtis</em> is its vigilant opportunism, and <em>kairos</em> is its rhetorical counterpart. Since the realm where <em>mêtis</em> applies is an antagonistic one with opposing forces striving against each other, <em>mêtis</em> “operates on a shifting terrain, in uncertain and ambiguous situations” (p. 14). Being cunning in such circumstances involves not only watchfulness, but, when the moment comes, sudden motion, and so it also requires knowledge both about the factors involved as well as the likely progression of events.</p>
					<p>That this aspect of <em>mêtis</em> is closely related to “the term <em>kairos</em>, opportunity,” Detienne and Vernant note, “although in a form which we must define more closely” (p. 15). The kind the authors mean is not mere recognition of the <em>kairic</em> moment, but rather mastery over it. Detienne and Vernant write <em>mêtis</em> “can seize the opportunity in as much as… it has been able to foresee how events will turn out and to prepare itself for this well in advance” (p.16). Thus, acting with <em>mêtis</em> means learning from the past, inhabiting the present, and manipulating the future beforehand. It means occupying the right positions in both space and time.</p>
					<p>This union of space with time is captured in the rhetorical concept of <em>kairos</em>, which, after long neglect, has enjoyed a revival in recent decades in theories related to agency (Herndl and Licona, 2004), religion (Crosby, 2011), and the rhetoric of science (Miller, 2013), among others. Much of modern rhetorical conceptions of <em>kairos</em> are drawn from Sippiora and Baumlin (2002) and ultimately from E.C White (1987), who derives the roots of the word from both archery and weaving, describing <em>kairos</em> as “a passing instant when an opening appears which must be driven through with force if success is to be achieved” (p.13).</p>
					<p>The metaphor of an opening, a window of time, and the movement necessary to clear it, whether by arrow or shuttle, again blurs the distinction between the mechanical and the discursive, allowing the archer, the weaver, or the rhetor to overtake the swiftly passing moment, as Detienne and Vernant write, “It is <em>mêtis</em> which, overtaking the <em>kairos</em>, however fleeting it may be, catches it by surprise” (p.16).</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section" id="copia">
					<h2>Mêtis and <em>Copia</em></h2>
					<p>To catch even <em>kairos</em> by surprise, one must already be in the right position, and thus the third essential characteristic of <em>mêtis</em>, polymorphism, has as its rhetorical counterpart <em>copia</em>, or, as Erasmus put it more fully: <em>duplici copia verborum ac rerum</em>, the duofold abundance of words and ideas. Again the reason for this need arises from the agonistic nature in which <em>mêtis</em> operates, shifting and ambiguous. Detienne and Vernant explain <em>mêtis</em> “is not one, not unified, but multiple and diverse . . . never at a loss, never without expedients <em>(poroi)</em> to get . . . out of any kind of trouble” (p.18). According to the authors, Oddysseus is the exemplar, and they describe him as "<em>polutropos</em>" (p.19), many-turning, or more plainly, crooked. This same quality, <em>polutropos</em>, is identified by Sippiora (2002) as “the special rhetorical ability to invent language appropriate to specific classes of listeners” (p.4).</p>
					<p>To be able to respond to these ever-shifting circumstances, to adapt whatever the situation, <em>mêtis</em> must be prepared with knowledge in advance. Detienne and Vernant write “But he will only be in a position to seize the opportunity . . . if he is sufficiently primed with all the knowledge acquired through experience” (p.312). It is this knowledge that gives rise to the opportunity, and Detienne and Vernant go on to explain how this “same indirect and groping knowledge is the lot of the type of man whom Plato’s and Aristotle’s contemporaries described as prudent <em>(phronimos)</em>" (p.313). The quality of prudence, or decorum, is thus more or less directly related to the concept of <em>copia</em>.</p>
					<p>In a speech or debate, circumstances may shift, for example in response to an interrogator or in reaction to the audience, and the speaker must improvise. In <em>Institutes of Oratory</em>, Quintillian writes of rhetorical rules, they “must generally be altered to suit the nature of each individual case, the time, the occasion, and necessity itself; consequently, one great quality in an orator is discretion, because he must turn his thoughts in various directions, according to different bearings of his subject” (p.383). This improvisation can only be accomplished by having ready to hand a copious storehouse of knowledge on a variety of topics. Quintillian writes how “an orator ought to be furnished, above all things, with an ample store of examples” (p.423) so the “orator, therefore, know as many as possible of every kind” (p.424).</p>
					<p>In his 14<sup>th</sup> century treatise on the topic, Erasmus explains the <em>telos</em> of <em>copia</em>; it’s “ultimate goal seems to be to equip a rhetor so that he can improvise as the occasion demands” (p.583).  Detienne and Vernant evoke <em>copia</em> when they write of the <em>mêtis</em>-filled orator, Themistocles: “In immediate problems he excelled in forming the best opinion, thanks to the most rapid reflection…. When dealing with any matter he also knew how to explain it clearly; even if he was not familiar with it he nevertheless formed a valuable opinion about it” (p.313). The ability to move rapidly in response to shifting circumstances is enabled by knowledge that is various and multiple, and, like the others aspects of <em>mêtis</em>, it is well-preserved in our rhetorical tradition.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section" id="snare">
					<h2>Mêtis and the Snare</h2>
					<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he fourth and final characteristic of <em>mêtis</em> has no obvious rhetorical cognate. According to Detienne and Vernant it is the essence of deceit: the power of disguise. They write: “In <em>mêtis</em> appearance and reality no longer correspond to one another but stand in contrast, producing an effect of illusion, <em>apate</em>, which beguiles the adversary into error and leaves him as bemused by his defeat as by the spells of a magician” (p. 21). For Detienne and Vernant, the perfect metaphor for this characteristic is the snare, and when the sophist, endowed with <em>mêtis</em>, practices this art, he becomes a “living trap” (p.40) or “living bond” (p.41) who ensnares his listeners in “the glittering web of his words” (p.22). Indeed, it seems this particular aspect of <em>mêtis</em> is largely what motivates the attacks on sophistry that Plato makes in <em>Gorgias</em> and <em>Phaedrus</em> and that Aristotle makes in <em>Rhetoric</em>.</p>
					<p>It is this capacity for deceit that seems to form the crux of their argument against the stoastic knowledge-making represented by <em>techne</em>. If, as Atwill has written, the sophistic <em>techne</em> has been neglected, but largely preserved by our tradition, the part that has apparently been excised is the use of disguise and other tactics that are employed with the intent to deceive the audience.</p>
					<p>In the famous section in <em>Gorgias</em>, oft-cited as a rejection of sophistry, when rhetoric is denigrated as flattery, as merely the “counterpart of cookery in the soul” (p.98), Plato refers explicitly to the art of disguise, writing “cookery is flattery <em>disguised</em> as medicine; and in just the same manner self-adornment <em>personates</em> gymnastic: with its rascally, deceitful, ignoble, and illiberal nature it deceives men by forms and colors, polish and dress, so as to make them, in the effort of assuming an extraneous beauty, neglect the native sort that comes through gymnastic . . . as self-adornment is to gymnastic, so is sophistry to legislation; and as cookery is to medicine, so is rhetoric to justice” (emphasis added, p.98). The rhetoric Plato excoriates here is predicated, according to him, on disguise, on deceit, on the art of concealing inner truth beneath a false exterior.</p>
					<p>And again, in <em>Phedrus</em>, as Socrates educates his pupil in the mechanism of persuasion, disguise is implicit to the discussion of “resemblances”. Plato writes, “then he who is to deceive another, and is not to be deceived himself, must know accurately the similarity and dissimilarity of things” (p.158). Being able to distinguish “the real nature of things” (p.158) is important precisely because it allows the possessor of this ability both to penetrate disguise and to perpetrate it.</p>
					<p>This same attitude (albeit with lesser bile) is evident in <em>Rhetoric</em>, when Aristotle writes  “What aims at reality is better than what aims at appearance” (196). This is because the audience is so crucial to determining the outcome of a rhetorical display. Aristotle writes “When people are feeling friendly and placable, they think one sort of thing; when they are feeling angry or hostile they think… something totally different” (p.213).</p>
					<p>Because the attitude of an audience so profoundly affects the outcome, any mask or disguise adopted by the rhetor can have a correspondingly profound effect on the success of the persuasion. The converse of this observation, however is the very redemptive power of rhetoric for which we’ve been searching. Detienne and Vernant write “Being on the watch for anything that might happen is a way of being able to forestall the cunning tricks of an enemy and to devise, in advance, ways of trapping him in his own net” (p.311). This is why, when Plato discusses deceit, he speaks of the ability to deceive and the ability to avoid deception at once: they are both aspects of the same intelligence.</p>
