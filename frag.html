<p>With anonymity comes power. In his chapter on the panopticon in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3593517">Michel Foucault (1977)</a> wrote that the ability to “dissimulate… to see without being seen” (p. 171) was the foremost “technology of power” (p. 23) shaping human history. This ability to see-without-being-seen conveys power through “the differential possession of knowledge” (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1050651993007001007">Ben Barton & Marthalee Barton, 1993, p. 139</a>).</p>
<p>To craft such a disguise is precisely to dissimulate, to pretend to be other than you are. This ability is also one of the main characteristics of the kind of intelligence the ancients called <em>mêtis</em>, and it is the operating principle behind all dark patterns. As we shall see, the fact that all these deceptive tactics rely on dissimulation is not coincidence: instead, it is their defining characteristic and it contains the mechanism by which their deception is effected.</p>
