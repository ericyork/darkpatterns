Mētis, daughter of Tethys, was an ocean goddess—a shapeshifter and the embodiment of cunning. She became Zeus' first wife after devising the stratagem that brought about Kronos' downfall and freed the Olympic host from the Titan's belly.

Following the marriage, Mētis became pregnant with Zeus' child, and so, heeding the council of the Titans, Zeus swallowed Mētis and took her power for himself, "becoming" according to Marcel Detienne and Paul Vernant (1972) "pure mētis" (p.4), that is, pure cunning.

Nevertheless, Hesiod tells us in Theogeny, Mētis' daughter Athena sprang forth from Zeus' brow "arrayed in arms of war" (930) and endowed with her mother's wisdom, her technē, to eventually become patron of the arts and champion of democracy.

The story of Mētis serves as apt allegory for a rhetorical tradition that has been "neglected" (according to Janet Atwill) or "effaced" (according to Jay Dolmage). Like the the goddess Mētis consumed by Zeus, the rhetorical roots of mētis are hidden, but still potent.

Many aspects of the kind of intelligence mētis embodies are present in the rhetorical traditions we've canonized, yet others are not. Meanwhile, these other aspects are in widespread use across a variety of contemporary media and they threaten critical components of communication, technology, and society.

In the sections that follow, I trace the outlines of a rhetoric of mētis deployed by individuals, organizations, and state actors to deceive, defraud, and destabilize communities. From the fake news dissemenated according to stolen Facebook data to the "alternative facts" spread by politicians; from blanket denials of wrongdoing, to the so-called "dark patterns" in user-experience design, mētis is enabled by the ubiquity of a variety of digital platforms.

In the end, I argue, rhetoricians, especially the digital kind, must recover this still-potent tradition if we are to be equipped to face the new dangers of the information age.
