							<h3>Fake Hair</h3>
							<p>In this example, the graphic designer who created the original image photoshopped a black line onto the underlying sneaker photo to make it appear a hair had gotten on the user's screen. Laid atop the bright white shoe and a light cream background, the black line achieves maximal contrast, making it highly visible. It has almost no shadow, so it appears to be sitting directly on the surface (as opposed to the sneaker itself, which has a prominent shadow). Finally, the black line has a realistic curve, lending authenticity to the illusion.</p>
							<p>While many users might detect this deception, a certain percentage will accidentally tap it. This percentage could be increased in certain contexts. For example, while transitioning from a white background might strain credulity, making the hair appear instantaneously, transitioning from a dark background could make it seem as if the hair had been there previously, heightening the illusion.</p>
							<p>Likewise, factors could reduce it's effectiveness. If the user has kinky, or, red or blonde hair, for example, that might be enough to break the illusion, so deploying this fake ad in geographical contexts where straight, dark hair predominates would be the most efficient choice.</p>
							<p>The effectiveness of the illusion depends entirely on its visual qualities. Had the contrast been less, or if the hair had been improperly shadowed, or if the hair had a curve that was less than natural, users could well have entirely different reactions and avoid tapping.</p>

							<h3>Speck of Dirt</h3>
							<p>This ad uses a similar trick. Instead of a hair, the designer has photoshopped two small specks onto the ad banner, making it seems a bit of dirt or food has become stuck to the device's screen. Like the fake hair, this illusion succeeds because of the naturalistic treatment.</p>
							<p>Again, we have a high contrast, low-shadow situation that enhances the interpretation that the specks are on the surface of the screen. Furthermore, there are actually multiple specks of various sizes and shapes. This irregularity lends credibility to the illusion. Finally, the specks are placed almost randomly on the banner: with plenty of surrounding whitespace to draw attention but enough asymmetry to make it seem accidental.</p>
							<p>This example and the previous one both rely on the <em>gestalt</em> principle of common region which states that when two obects occupy the same area, one is percieved as laying atop the other.</p>

							<h3>False Collapsible</h3>
							<p>This example uses a modified techniqe. Instead of disguising itself as a natural object, the malicious link masquerades as another interface element entirely: a collapse icon. On mobile screens, when drawers or panels "slide" into view atop the main interface, typically there is by convention a way to slide it back: often an arrow of some sort pointing in the direction the user wants to send the panel. When the panel is on the bottom of the screen, as in this example, it points downward, to hide the panel in that direction.</p>
							<p>In this example, the downward pointing arrow does not collapse the panel, but instead takes users to the sponsor's website. This illusion succeeds not by mimicking the natural world like the fake hair or the speck of dirt, but instead by mimicking a UI element. Since the designer is mimicking an artificial object, the job is much easier and the risk of detection is much lower. Unless the user has encountered this particular disguise before, there is no way to know what will happen when clicking the downward caret.</p>
							<p>This exploits Jacob's Law, which states that since users spend most of their time on websites other than yours, yours should look and function the same way the others do.</p>

							<h3>Requirement not Required</h3>
							<p><em>Please note</em>: to view the full image (the tweet here only shows a cropped version), you'll want to click or tap the tweet to go to Twitter.com, then right-click or tap-and-hold on the image itself to view it full size.</p>
							<p>The examples on this page of disguise have heretofor been fairly blatant. But some are far more subtle. Take the fake requirements, for example. Capitalizing on the conventions of web forms (and some selectively muted text) the designer is able to disguise the optional email collection as the main form input element. Due to size, color, and other visual properties, the email collection form seems to be the required field, but in reality it's the terms and conditions checkbox below it that is the required field.</p>
							<p>This pattern succeeds because it exploits the <em>gestalt</em> principle of proximity, which states that objects that are near each other in space are assumed to belong to a group. The email input is assumed to be part of the required inputs for the form as a whole.</p>
							<p>This example is also interesting because of how the written copy uses strategic ambiguity. Notice the small phrase beneath the main copy: "available to all airport guests." Why include that bit? Likewise, why is there a second call-to-action above the email input field? I'd speculate it's to bolster legal arguments that the design fully informs users they don't need to enter their email address to use the wi-fi, even though the rest of the design makes a powerful implicit argument to do so.</p>

							<h3>Very Low Contrast</h3>
							<p>This example is quite typical. The link to unsubscribe from the list appears near the very bottom of the document, at a very small size&mdash;in the digital fine print, as it were. This particular example, though, amplifies the fine print effect by setting the color of the text and the color of the background to be only slightly different, making it much harder to read.</p>
							<p>The color of the word “unsubscribe” is set equal to the color of the surrounding text, rather than to the color of other links, as can be seen by comparing “unsubscribe” with “peter@gmail.com”. The WCAG 2.0 specify a <em>minimum</em> (Level A) contrast of 3:1 for text approximately 18 pixels in height. Smaller text requires higher contrast, and this minimal level is largely ignored in favor of the industry standard (Level AA) contrast of 4.5:1. In this example, the color contrast is so poor it fails minimal conformance testing at any size.</p>

							<h3>Lack of Affordance</h3>
							<p>In this variation, the link to unsubscribe is too small and has poor contrast as before, but in addition it also lacks the underline affordance that is a feature of other links. In UI-speak, an affordance is a visual feature that gives the user some clue as to the function of a particular element: in this case that the word is a clickable hyperlink.</p>
							<p>Since other clickable hyperlinks on the page are underlined, and due to the <em>gestalt</em> principle of similarity that declares that elements that are visually similar are percieved as part of a group, a user may well conclude the word “unsubscribe” is not a link.</p>
							<p>This example and the others in this category all rely on a common <em>gestalt</em> principle, figure-ground. Making it difficult for viewers to distinguish which is figure and which is ground is the basis of many well-known visual illusions, and it takes advantage of internet readers' wewll-known tendency to skim. Now that we've focused on the unsubscribe links, they may be more visible. Imagine encountering them in their natural contexts, as part of much larger pages of information.</p>

							<h3>Burying the Lede</h3>
							<p>This example takes the pattern a step further. In addition to removing affordances like color and underlining, the unsubscribe link is placed about as near in the center of the page as possible, buried at the end of a sentence in the middle of an otherwise nondescript paragraph.</p>
							<p>A user skimming the page to locate the unsubscribe link would have a difficult time indeed in spotting it, and all the more so if the user suspects the link might be on a different page entirely, as the text at the very bottom of the image is careful to point out.</p>
							<p>This example illustates how powerful the <em>gestalt</em> principles of similarity and proximity can be when used in consort with figure-ground: finding a single barely-distinguishable word among scores of other words is like finding a needle in a haystack. Posssible, certainly, but surely tedious in the extreme.</p>
							<p>It's interesting to note here how color is used not so the link blends into the background (the text contrast meets AA conformance), but rather so that it will better blend in with the text around it. This is a slight adaptation of the figure-ground exploit.</p>

							<h3>Link Shifting</h3>
							<p>This example combines several of the previous exploits and adds a new one. In addition to poor contrast (fails Level A conformance) and tiny font size (it's 11 pixels, much smaller than the 18px commonly used for regular text, and lacks link affordance (no underline), this example also shifts the location of the hyperlink.</p>
							<p>In previous variations of this pattern, the word “unsubscribe” <em>is</em> a link, even if they don't look like it, but in this version, the actual hyperlink is around the word “link” instead.</p>
							<p>This example seems targetted toward a savvier user&mdash;one wise to the ways of disguised unsubscribe links and innured to their techniques. In the case, however, the savvy user may well try to click on the word “unsubscsribe” a few times before giving up, believing there to be no link here at all.</p>
							<p>Meanwhile, the real link hides a few words away, the effectiveness of its disguise renewed by means of what amounts to a distraction, a red herring, if you will. In first proferring a flawed disguise, the real link is able to perpertrate the same disguise more effectively.</p>
