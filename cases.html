			    <h1>Patterns of Disguise</h1>
					<p>Dark patterns in this category use the visual properties of objects, such as size, shape, color, and depth to make a malicious object appear to be another, more benign object instead.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<div class="entry-wrap">
						<div class="eg-text">
							<h3>Strikingly's False Collapsible</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>his kind of dark pattern operates almost entirely through manipulation of visual properties and has less to do with actual content, except inasmuch as the true content of things has been disguised by the design. We’ve already seen one example of disguise in Figure ##, “Fake Hair”, but here we’ll focus on the “Strikingly Ad” posted by @twitterhandle on Month Day, year.</p>
							<p>In Figure ## we see the advertisement as it would appear on a mobile device: annoyingly jutting up from the bottom of the screen and covering precious pixels of screen real estate. Helpfully, a downward-pointing triangle seems to offer the option of closing the panel, however, when clicked, the triangle instead takes users to a webpage. The downward-pointing triangle is the thing that’s been disguised: an external link has been rendered as a panel toggle. The thing, a link, doesn’t match its representation, a toggle.</p>
							<h3>The Crooked Mind</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap i">I</span>n terms of metis, this example exhibits all four aspects. The purpose of the design is to reverse the user’s intention: instead of closing the advertisement, the user must be made to visit the site. Deactivate must be converted to activate. The Strikingly ad must first create an opportunity, it must prompt an action. It does this by creating what appears to be a collapsible panel that obscures part of the screen.</p>
							<p>To reclaim this portion of their screen, the user looks for a way to dismiss the panel and spots a prominently rendered downward-pointing triangle, commonly called a caret, that typically signifies, or stands in for, a means of collapsing such panels. In fact, the hidden functionality of this interface element is to trigger, not the collapse of the panel, but instead a navigational link that loads a document on another server: in this case apparently Strikingly’s website. This probably serves to creates artificial traffic to the host site and inflate its value.</p>
							<p>The “form” or “design” of the navigational link has been transformed into a caret, and this disguise allows something malicious, intentionally misdirected traffic, to masquerade as something benign. Like the bait of the angler fish, “inner malice is concealed beneath a seductive exterior” (p.??).</p>
							<h3>The Invisible Eye</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>his disguise is effected by exploiting the conventions of visual design: by convention, collapsible panels have a way to close them, and by convention this is often represented by a downward-pointing caret. This is reinforced by the fact that direction the caret points is the direction in which the user wants to “send” the panel. </p>
							<p>Aside from these semiotic confusions, the disguise also works by by exploiting what's known as “Jakob’s Law of User Experience”,  after UX pioneer Jakob Nielsen, which states: “Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know” (Yablonski, 2019).</p>
							<p>In visual rhetorical terms, this is related to two gestalt principles: the Law of Similarity and the Law of Common Fate. The Law of Similarity is simply that objects that are visually similar are perceived to be part of group. The Law of Common Fate states that objects moving in the same direction are perceived as belonging to a group. Based on these simple rules, users will expect the downward-pointing caret to collapse the panel that contains it, not take them to another site entirely.</p>

							<h3>Raconteur's Unsubscribe Trickery</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap d">D</span>ark patterns in this category are similar to those of disguise, in that they rely almost entirely on the visual properties of objects, but different in that the properties have the effect of making things blend into their surroundings, instead of making them stand out. Unlike “Fake Hair” or “Speck of Dirt”, these dark patterns rely on camouflage, rather than disguise.</p>
							<p>We’ve seen an example of camouflage already, in Figure ##, “Hard to Unsubscribe”, but here we’ll focus on the Preferences screen of the business website Raconteur, as posted by @twitterhandle on Month Day, year. In this figure we see the preferences page as it would appear on a desktop: a series of newsletter types paired with checkboxes, followed by a paragraph of text, a big green “Save Preferences” and a smaller line of text containing a link to other help article, in green.</p>
							<p>A user who unchecked all the boxes and clicked the button would be sorely tempted to read the sentence below it. Ostensibly the purpose of the sentence is to provide a link to a help page, signified by the green word “here” in the figure, but it's real importance is to perform a kind of cognitive priming: it also says to users ‘this bold green text is what a link looks like’ on this page. Upon clicking the button, a user would still continue to be marketed to.</p>
							<p>A more careful user will see the words “unsubscribe link here” in the middle of the final paragraph of text, but may note that it is not formatted like the only other link on the page, also on the word “here”, below the button. This more careful reader may very well conclude there is no link on this here and instead click on the other “here” on the page. This camouflage makes the real unsubscribe link very difficult to find. The link has been made to seem not a link, and the fake link is made to seem as the only real one.</p>
							<h3>The Crooked Mind</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>his example also maps straightforwardly onto our four aspects of metis. Users presumably came to this page into to unsubscribe from annoying marketing email “newsletters”, and so the design needs to reverse this intention. It creates opportunity by cluttering the visual field and the problem space: now unsubscribing is a set of different acts, unsubscribing from the various newsletters, or not, or unsubscribing altogether (it being ambiguous what this means).</p>
							<p>In this more cluttered visual and semantic field, the link that leads to a form to unsubscribe altogether takes the form of regular paragraph text, which it is not, and thus it blends in and becomes invisible. It is may still yet more invisible by the presence of a visually-stimulating example of a link, a very different styling of the same word, to reinforce the meaning of the design language being employed.</p>
							<p>This camouflage will prevent at least some users from unsubscribing, which artificially inflates the value of the product at the expense of users’ time and attention. In this example, the true form a link take changes, it shifts, and the meaning of what link is transformed as well. This allows the creation of a true disguise. The route of escape has been hidden: the user is ensnared.</p>
							<h3>The Invisible Eye</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>his camouflage is effected also by exploiting the conventions of visual design. The convention of consistency would dictate that hyperlinks in paragraph text all be styled the same way. Like the dark patterns of disguise, dark patterns of camouflage also rely on the gestalt Law of Similarity and Jakob’s Law.</p>
							<p>The visual properties of the hyperlink—its color and font-weight are assumed to define membership in a group, and, since almost all other websites style links consistently, users would expect this one to do the same, but it doesn’t. In addition to these laws, however, dark patterns of camouflage also rely heavily on the gestalt concept figure-ground contrast, which states that objects that have more contrast with their surroundings have more visual salience.</p>
							<p>In the case of this example, the hyperlink style achieves contrast with its surrounding text, and becomes the most salient bit of body text. Since it’s not a link to a place the user wants to go, this salience works as a kind of red-herring, a visual misdirection combined with the invisibility of the true link (it doesn't have any contrast with its surrounding text), serve to camouflage only escape route. The designers made it as small and as invisible as they could and still plausibly maintain good faith.</p>

			    <h1>Patterns of Misdirection</h1>
					<p>Dark Patterns in this category use visual properties to induce users to pay attention to one set of concerns at the expense of another.</p>

							<h3>Free Plan Red-Herring</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap m">M</span>ore explicitly than the previous example of camouflage, the dark patterns in this category use visual properties to induce users to pay attention to one set of objects at the expense of another. This is not true disguise, nor really camouflage, but instead relies more on principles of figure ground contrast, the idea of visual weight, or visual attraction, and what Arnheim calls the anisotropic view of space, or the idea that space in difference places is not the same, i.e it has different value. Some locations are privileged, in that they draw attention to themselves or occupy hierarchically-dominant locations.</p>
							<p>In Figure ##, posted to Twitter by user @twitterhandle on Month, day, year, we see an example of this kind of misdirection. The user arrived on this page having chosen to continue with the “Free Plan”. Instead, the user is taken to a page of plans, the most basic of which is highlighted visually and comes sequentially first in order. Other plans that follow are more comprehensive, and various details of each are presented to users.</p>
							<p>Many will click the “Confirm Trial” button highlighted in blue. However, the real link to the free trial is just a phrase far in the upper-right corner of the whole page colored an innocuous blue and without underline. It might not even be a link but instead a description of the page as a whole. This is the actual link, if the user can find it. But it is hidden in plain sight by the visually signaling.</p>
							<h3>The Crooked Mind</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>his example exhibits a different kind of metis, more subtle and more brazen. The user had chosen to continue with the free plan, and to subvert this, the design must induce the user to select a paid plan without knowing it. It creates the opportunity for the deception, by splitting the plan options into multiple plans: now the single thing has become many. Which is the correct one is confused by the presentation of so many details arranged just so on the page: in sequence.</p>
							<p>A different plan than the one the user wanted is made to stand in its place, one becomes the other, is disguised as the other. Meanwhile the true free plan is disguised as a plain and seemingly disconnected bit of text, unrelated in kind to the other plan presented most prominently. This disguise serves to conceal an inner malice.</p>
							<p>The exterior of the paid plan is seductive, it masquerades as the free plan, but it conceals its malicious intent: in reality those who take that path and follow the remainder of its steps will find they owe charges that are difficult and annoying to stop. This fake free plan is the gateway to a credit card entry form, and woe to the user that enters his or her account information there.</p>
							<h3>The Invisible Eye</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap v">V</span>isually, this kind of dark pattern depends on the gestalt principle we’ve already discussed, grouping by similarity, principles of consistency, and figure ground contrast, but these kind of dark patterns exploits them fully. In situations when designers must present a varied set of information, visual and typographic hierarchies are used to create structure and relationships, and indeed we see the same here with different typographic treatments of data, the order sequence of plans, and the visual highlighting of the most important set of information, the recommended plan.</p>
							<p>It occupies the most visually privileged location on the page: it has the most visual weight (derived from contrast with the blue colors), and it is first in the sequence. The highlighted button reads “Confirm Trial”, while all the other buttons read, “Start Free Trial”, indicating to users that this one is the plan they had previously selected, even though it’s not.</p>
							<p>In perhaps the least-privilege position on the page, the far upper-right corner, indicated in the figure by the red-arrow (presumably added by the Twitter user who posted it), is the link for the user to confirm the free plan. This kind of deception works by creating and then subverting a visual hierarchy, more sophisticated than either disguise or camouflage.</p>

					<h1>Patterns of Disorientation</h1>
					<p>Dark Patterns in this category rely on ambiguous affordances and confusing microcopy to turn up into down, wrong into right, no into yes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<div class="entry-wrap">
						<div class="eg-text">
							<p><span class="dropcap s">S</span>imilarly to dark patterns of misdirection, those of disorientation perform their deception in plain sight, as it were, through sophisticated confusion, but this category is notable for the fact that the thing being disguised in these examples is not an object on the page as it is so much a whole semantic category: in the case the meaning of yes and no, of red and green, of selected and unselected.</p>
							<p>In the Figure ##, posted to Twitter by user @twitterhandle on Month, day, year, we see what appears by now be a familiar trope: an array of choices. However, a combination of wording and the counterintuitive function of the selection toggles makes it entirely unclear which “version” of reality we must embrace: one in which yes means no and green means bad? Or the familiar patterns that equate yes with confirmation and green with safety?</p>
							<h3>The Crooked Mind</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he kind of metis involved here is more radical, involving as it does the meaning of basic words, colors, and interface concepts. It’s seeking to reverse the user’s intent to unsubscribe, and it does so, as before, by presenting an array of options. Rather than simple checkboxes, however, these options are configured by kind of toggle, whose function is encoded with the words “Yes” and “No” and the colors red and green.</p>
							<p>A small white square constitutes the toggle. When the user selects an option (either Yes or No), the white square slides over to cover the word the user tapped, leaving the other word visible, highlighted in green if yes, and in red, if no. Which has been selected? Moreover, which is the correct one?</p>
							<p>Rather than discussing one thing as another, or hiding something in plain sight, this kind of Metis has transformed the very nature of what yes and no means, what red and green means, what selected and unselected means. Many users could easily misinterpret these form elements and unintentionally enable the whole suite of marketing spam targeted at whatever poor inbox the user enters.</p>
							<h3>The Invisible Eye</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap f">F</span>rom a visual perspective, less relies on concealment and more on generating ambiguity. As in the case of misdirection, a visual hierarchy is established and used, but here it is consistent. The color green, representative of success or safety, is articulated with the yes answer (meaning to opt in), while the color red, representative of warning or danger, is articulated with the no answer (opting out of the marketing spam).</p>
							<p>To confuse matters further, the toggle slider does not work as expected. By convention, a toggle has two states: one end or the other, but this one has three states including an ambiguous middle. When one end is selected, however, that end isn’t highlighted, but instead its completely obscured by the white square, on a white background making it effectively invisible.</p>
							<p>So selecting “No” would make the word “no” and its red background disappear, leaving only the “yes” in view. The “yes” would appear to be “selected” in the conventional sense, since it’s been made visible by the toggle action, but the white square has moved to the “No” end, so does that mean “No” has been selected?</p>
							<p>The combination of words, colors, and the color/effect of the toggle slider makes the meaning of any semantic bit, while consistent, completely ambiguous. These cardinal signs: yes and now, bad and good, right and wrong, have been confused, and in the absence of their surety, the user becomes completely disoriented, as apt to blunder into danger as away from it.</p>

			    <h1>Patterns of Intimidation</h1>
					<p>Patterns in which the sheer mental effort involved in an action discourages users from attempting it, or those in which users are otherwise frightened away.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<div class="entry-wrap">
						<div class="eg-text">
							<p><span class="dropcap m">M</span>uch as dark patterns of disorientation call into question cardinal ideas and their signs, patterns of intimidation rely heavily on the disruption of norms and the more cognitive aspects. These kind of patterns are more clearly caused by content elements than they are caused by design elements.</p>
							<p>In cases like these, one thing does indeed become another, but its not a link or a concept: its a value proposition. What had once appeared to be a relatively quick and easy task is transformed into an overwhelmingly tedious one.</p>
							<p>In the Figure ##, posted to Twitter by user @twitterhandle on Month, day, year, we see how the designers from Tumblr have taken the creation of multiple categories to unsubscribe from to the extreme. A user coming to unsubscribe finds a clear enough listing of options using the familiar toggle style.</p>
							<p>However instead of there being three or four options that need to be disabled, there are more than three-hundred and fifty different messaging services that need to be unsubscribed from, and there is no way to deactivate all of them at once.</p>
							<p>Instead, the user must scroll through a lengthy list, manually unselecting each toggle. For many users, this will simply exceed the threshold for tedium and the user will instead choose the path of least resistance and leave them all selected, resulting in unstoppable emails.</p>
							<h3>The Crooked Mind</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he metis of this category of dark patterns, as illustrated by this example, is of a different order than others we’ve seen so far, yet it still exhibits all four aspects of cunning. Nothing in the interface per se has been deceptively transformed, there’s no hidden link, no confusing toggle.</p>
							<p>As before, the interface must reverse the user’s intent and to decide to remain subscribed. As before, the interface creates an opportunity by redirecting the user to a page where the act of unsubscribing has been broken into separate components. But now, the disguise is revealed: what had seemed a simple task (opting out) has been turned into an extremely tedious one; an interface ostensibly designed to assist users is reveal as actively hostile.</p>
							<p>The extreme multiplication of objects, of settings that must be configured to unsubscribe totally from the service, amounts to a kind of emotional intimidation. “Don’t even try it”, the interface seems to snarl. The regular relationship with the text has been reversed: instead of the interface as a helper, or as pretending to help at least, this interface is overtly malignant, threatening.</p>
							<h3>The Invisible Eye</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap v">V</span>isually, this intimidation is supported and enabled by an absurdly overloaded, though otherwise entirely conventional layout. Various psychological and visual principles are at work here, from the relatively small number of objects humans can hold in working memory, to the undifferentiated length of the list itself, so long and so internally similar a user could easily become lost.</p>
							<p>Collectively, these understandings can be represented by what UX designers know as Hick’s Law, which is “The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices” (Yablonski, 2019, p.??). For each item on the list, each other item becomes measurably more difficult to complete.</p>
							<p>Taken to the extreme of “350+” (I could not independently verify this number) amounts nothing short of a slap in the face of the user. From a the visual and informational design perspective, such a list is the equivalent of a cadre of thugs showing up to muscle you out of your money.<p>

			    <h1>Patterns of Manipulation</h1>
					<p>Dark Patterns of this type require users to adopt morally compromising positions and identities that conflict with their preferred self-image to trigger emotions like guilt and shame.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="modal-body">
					<div class="entry-wrap">
						<div class="eg-text">
							<p><span class="dropcap e">E</span>ven more overtly than the previous category, and in a very different way than disguises and camouflage, dark patterns of this type attempt to situate users differently than expected, to articulate them into morally and ethically compromised roles in order to coerce their behavior. While some of these use humor, ambiguously acknowledged, others “play it straight”, and achieve ambiguity from that direction.</p>
							<p>In the Figure ##, posted to Twitter by user @twitterhandle on Month, day, year, we see how this fairly typical-looking email submission form manipulates constituted identity to position users into the morally compromising position that they don’t care about their pets. In this case, as with intimidation, the interface is relatively clear in its structure, but the deception occurs at another level.</p>
							<p>A user may well feel uncomfortable enough about the admission they figure that giving up their email address is small enough price to pay, or they may be won over by the ambiguous humor of the copy, and decide to submit their email expecting more of the same in the newsletter, either way the user has been coerced by emotional manipulation.</p>
							<h3>The Crooked Mind</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap t">T</span>he kind of metis exhibited by dark patterns of this kind is cynical, self-referential, ambiguously aligned. While patterns of intimidation are overt in how they frustrate the user’s intent, patterns of emotional manipulation are overt about the act of manipulation itself.</p>
							<p> They acknowledge to users by their extreme formulations that they are manipulative, moreover they offer to bring users in on the joke. They reverse the role of interface and they disguise where the immorality lies. This kind of metis transforms the nature of the transaction here: what had once become a question of whether to sign up for an email newsletter has become a struggle of contested morality.</p>
							<p>The identity of the interface as assistant is absent completely, the interface is the opponent, but it’s not a mental challenge, its a moral one, and ethical problem. Are you the kind of person who doesn’t care what your beloved pet eats?</p>
							<p>Who is the ethically compromised party, actually? While the interface makes the implicit claim the user doesn’t care for their pet until they’ve subscribed, it is the interface that shows its lack of care by this exaggerated manipulation.</p>
							<h3>The Invisible Eye</h3>
							<p><span class="dropcap v">V</span>isually, we see many of the same rhetorical features as before. The text on the popup add is bright and large, except the opt-out link. The email submission field is presented as the only viable escape route from the dialogue, prompting you to give up these personal details, and the link to opt out or refuse doesn’t look like a button of any kind.</p>
							<p>It is composed of extra small, low contrast text without any obviously hyperlink affordances (such as an underline), that would reveal its function. Instead, users must focus on blocking out everything else on the form, visually speaking, to bring the text to the level where it can be read.</p>
							<p>The “No thanks” in the first position in the sentence strikes a tone of politeness, but when followed by “I don’t care what my cat eats”, the effect is to create a feeling of rejection. “Of course I care what my cat eats.” This moment of outrage is perhaps followed by a little shame, surely it must be a joke, right?</p>
							<p>The main deceptive issue with the visual design, however, is the size of the link target itself. Presumably only one word of the entire sentence is the actual link, and it’s not clear which word. Tapping around multiple times is likely to trigger the email field. All the while, the moral accusation has time to take hold. The user does care what his or her pet eats. Why not just enter the email? And the ploy can succeed.</p>
